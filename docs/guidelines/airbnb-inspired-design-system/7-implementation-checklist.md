# 7. Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist during **planning**, **implementation**, and **verification** of all components, pages, and stories.

## Planning Phase

- [ ] Design follows core principles (Friendly Clarity, Trust through Fidelity, Accent Focus, Breathing Layout)
- [ ] Color usage follows 60-30-10 rule
- [ ] Typography scale is applied correctly
- [ ] Spacing uses 8-point grid system
- [ ] Responsive strategy is defined for all breakpoints
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are considered

## Implementation Phase

- [ ] Tailwind configuration includes design system tokens
- [ ] Components use design system color classes
- [ ] Typography uses Inter/Poppins fonts
- [ ] Border radius follows guidelines (12px for cards, 8px for inputs)
- [ ] Shadows use two-layer system (shadow-soft, shadow-card, shadow-modal)
- [ ] Gradients applied to primary CTAs
- [ ] Animations use standard durations (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- [ ] Hover states are implemented for all interactive elements
- [ ] Focus states are visible and meet accessibility standards
- [ ] Layout uses Flexbox/Grid for responsive behavior
- [ ] Components reorganize naturally at breakpoints

## Verification Phase

- [ ] Visual appearance matches design system guidelines
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI)
- [ ] Typography is readable and properly scaled
- [ ] Spacing is consistent and follows 8-point grid
- [ ] Shadows are subtle and consistent
- [ ] Animations are smooth (60fps target)
- [ ] Hover/focus states work correctly
- [ ] Layout is responsive across all breakpoints (360px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified
- [ ] No browser console errors or warnings
- [ ] Motion preferences respected (`prefers-reduced-motion`)
