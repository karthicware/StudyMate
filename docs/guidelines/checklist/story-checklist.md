### Acceptance Criteria (AC) Coverage
- [ ] Playwright Tests: Every AC validated with Playwright tests. Before writing E2E Playwright tests, kill all running frontend and backend ports to avoid timeout issues.
- [ ] Responsive Testing: Validate across desktop (1440px), tablet (768px), mobile (375px).
- [ ] Console Monitoring: No errors or warnings in browser console during tests.
- [ ] ESLint Compliance: All ESLint violations must be verified and fixed before story completion.

## ðŸ“‹ Reporting Requirement
- [ ] Once unit testing is completed against each AC, generate a report and attach it to the corresponding AC in the dev notes section. The report should include:
    - Test status (Pass/Fail)
    - Evidence (test reports, screenshots, console logs as applicable)
    - For UI-related ACs: browser log and error messages if any
    - For backend/server-related ACs: server console error messages (stack traces, error logs) must be reported and included in the dev notes or relevant artifacts
    - Reference to any relevant artifacts (e.g., screenshot filenames)
- [ ] **Playwright E2E Testing for UI Acceptance Criteria (MANDATORY)**:
    - Every acceptance criteria related to UI must have comprehensive Playwright browser E2E testing
    - E2E test coverage percentage must be tracked and updated at the end of the story
    - **Expected Coverage: 100%** - All UI acceptance criteria must be validated with automated E2E tests
    - Report must include E2E test coverage metrics and any gaps with justification
