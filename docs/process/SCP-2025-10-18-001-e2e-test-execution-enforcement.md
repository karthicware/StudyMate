# Sprint Change Proposal: E2E Test Execution Quality Gate Enforcement

**Proposal ID**: SCP-2025-10-18-001
**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Author**: Bob (Scrum Master)
**Trigger**: Developer agent wrote E2E tests without executing them (Story 1.4)
**Severity**: HIGH (Quality Gate Failure)
**Scope**: Process improvement + 2 story remediations
**Status**: APPROVED

---

## 1. Issue Summary

**Problem Statement**:
Developer agent marked Story 1.4 as "Done" with 12 E2E tests written but never executed. Audit revealed this is systemic: 2 of 3 "Done" stories (67%) have unexecuted E2E tests.

**Root Cause**:
No explicit enforcement mechanism exists to prevent "Done" status without executed tests. Story template and Definition of Done are ambiguous about execution vs. writing tests.

**Impact Analysis**:
- **Immediate**: Story 1.4 and 1.4.1 have unvalidated code
- **Systemic**: Process allows quality gate bypass
- **Risk**: Production bugs from untested code
- **Epic Impact**: LOW (no scope changes, process fix only)
- **MVP Impact**: None (features work, just need validation)

**Audit Findings**:
- ✅ Story 0.1.1: 15 E2E tests executed and passing (33%)
- ❌ Story 1.4: 12 E2E tests written but NOT executed (33%)
- ❌ Story 1.4.1: E2E tests deferred, not executed (33%)

---

## 2. Recommended Path Forward

**Selected Approach**: **Option 4 - Hybrid Approach** (Phased Remediation)

**Phase 1 - Immediate** (2025-10-18, ~2-3 hours):
- ✅ Create formal Definition of Done checklist
- ✅ Update story template with execution mandates
- ✅ Update testing documentation
- ✅ Add hard stops to developer agent instructions

**Phase 2 - This Sprint** (Next 2 days, ~2-3 hours):
- Execute Story 1.4 E2E tests (12 tests)
- Fix any discovered failures
- Document execution results

**Phase 3 - Next Sprint** (Following week, ~3-4 hours):
- Create database seed data for Story 1.4.1
- Execute Story 1.4.1 E2E tests
- Document execution results

**Total Effort**: 7-10 hours over 2 sprints

## 3. Implemented Changes (Phase 1 Complete)

### ✅ Created: Definition of Done Document
**File**: `docs/process/definition-of-done.md`
**Status**: CREATED
**Content**: Comprehensive DoD checklist with explicit E2E execution requirements

### ✅ Updated: E2E Testing Guide
**File**: `docs/testing/e2e-testing-guide.md`
**Status**: UPDATED
**Changes**: Added "CRITICAL: E2E Test Execution Requirement" section with:
- Execution mandate (6 steps)
- Execution commands
- Evidence requirements format
- Failure handling protocol

### ✅ Updated: Story Template
**File**: `.bmad-core/templates/story-tmpl.yaml`
**Status**: UPDATED
**Changes**:
- Added E2E execution mandate to "E2E Integration Testing Requirements" section
- Added new "Definition of Done Checklist" section before Change Log
- DoD checklist includes unit tests, E2E tests, integration tests, documentation, and completion criteria

### ✅ Updated: Developer Agent Instructions
**File**: `.bmad-core/agents/dev.md`
**Status**: UPDATED
**Changes**:
- Added "quality_gates" section with E2E Test Execution Enforcement rules
- Added HARD STOP behavior for unexecuted tests
- Added VIOLATION BEHAVIOR: HALT and prompt user

## 4. Remediation Status

### Story 1.4: Seat Map Editor
**Current Status**: Done (Pending E2E Execution)
**Remediation**: Phase 2 (This Sprint)
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Execute 12 E2E tests
- [ ] Fix any failures
- [ ] Document execution evidence
- [ ] Remove "Pending" qualifier

### Story 1.4.1: Ladies-Only Seat Configuration
**Current Status**: Done (Pending E2E Execution)
**Remediation**: Phase 3 (Next Sprint)
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create database seed data
- [ ] Execute E2E tests
- [ ] Document execution evidence
- [ ] Remove "Pending" qualifier

---

## 5. Success Criteria

✅ **Phase 1 Complete** (DONE - 2025-10-18):
- Definition of Done document created
- E2E testing guide updated with mandates
- Story template updated with DoD checklist and E2E mandate
- Developer agent instructions updated with quality gates
- All process artifacts in place and enforced

⏳ **Phase 2 In Progress**:
- Story 1.4 E2E tests executed and passing
- Evidence documented in story

⏳ **Phase 3 Pending**:
- Story 1.4.1 seed data created
- Story 1.4.1 E2E tests executed and passing

✅ **Long-term Goal**:
- Zero stories marked "Done" without executed E2E tests after 2025-10-18
