# Story 1.16.1: Owner Footer - Design System Alignment (Section 9)

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Owner Dashboard & Analytics
**Feature:** Feature 1.5 - Owner Portal Infrastructure
**Story Points:** 2 SP
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Type:** Infrastructure (Frontend)

---

## User Story

**As an** Owner,
**I want** the footer component to follow the Airbnb-inspired design system specifications (Section 9)
**so that** I have a visually consistent, premium, and professional portal experience.

---

## Context

Story 1.16 implemented the Owner Portal Footer with basic information, but was completed before Section 9 (Header and Footer Component Specifications) was added to the design system. This story updates the footer's visual styling and layout to align with the new specifications while preserving essential Owner Portal links.

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.16 must be complete (functional footer exists)
- Design system Section 9 specifications finalized

**Related Documentation:**
- [Section 9: Footer Specifications](../../guidelines/airbnb-inspired-design-system/9-header-and-footer-component-specifications.md)
- [Responsive Strategy](../../guidelines/airbnb-inspired-design-system/3-responsive-strategy-the-breathing-layout.md)

## Story Estimate Breakdown

| Task | Estimated Time | Complexity |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Update HTML template (colors, layout, grid) | 2 hours | Low |
| Add navigation columns content | 1 hour | Low |
| Update TypeScript (footer data structure) | 1 hour | Low |
| Playwright test updates | 1 hour | Low |
| Visual regression testing | 1 hour | Low |
| **Total** | **6 hours** | **2 SP** |

## Notes

- This story is purely visual/layout - no API changes
- Focus on Owner Portal specific navigation (not consumer-facing links)
- Ensure footer is "sticky" at bottom of page (via layout component)
- Collaborate with designer if clarification needed on content structure
