## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 1.14a** (Fix Router Test Configuration) identified the need for Router test utilities:
- AC5 and AC6 deferred to this story (1.14b)
- Test patterns needed for Stories 1.15-1.21 (routing infrastructure)
- Router configuration was already correct, but utilities would prevent duplication
- RouterLink directive testing pattern needed for components with navigation links

**Story 1.2.1** (Fix OwnerRegisterComponent Tests) will benefit from these utilities:
- OwnerRegisterComponent uses RouterLink directive
- Proper Router configuration pattern documented
- Utilities can be applied to simplify test setup

**Key Learning:** Reusable test utilities reduce duplication, enforce consistency, and speed up test development across multiple stories.

### Architecture Overview

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with TypeScript, Signals, Tailwind CSS
- **Testing Framework**: Jasmine/Karma (Unit), Playwright (E2E)
- **Router**: Angular Router with standalone components
- **Test Utilities**: Custom test utilities in `src/testing/`

### Angular 20 Router Testing Patterns

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#angular-standards]

**Pattern 1: Isolated Component Tests (Standalone Components)**
```typescript
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  imports: [ComponentUnderTest],
  providers: [provideRouter([])] // Empty routes for isolation
});
```

**Pattern 2: Integration Tests with Routes**
```typescript
import { RouterTestingModule } from '@angular/router/testing';

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  imports: [
    ComponentUnderTest,
    RouterTestingModule.withRoutes(TEST_ROUTES)
  ]
});
```

**Pattern 3: Navigation Spy Tests**
```typescript
const routerSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj('Router', ['navigate', 'navigateByUrl']);

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  imports: [ComponentUnderTest],
  providers: [{ provide: Router, useValue: routerSpy }]
});
```

### Utility Implementation Details

**File: `src/testing/router-test-utils.ts`**

```typescript
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

/**
 * Provides empty router configuration for isolated component tests.
 *
 * Use this when testing standalone components that don't need actual routing,
 * but use RouterLink or other router directives.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * TestBed.configureTestingModule({
 *   imports: [MyComponent],
 *   providers: [provideRouterMock()]
 * });
 * ```
 */
export function provideRouterMock() {
  return provideRouter([]);
}

/**
 * Creates a Router spy for tests that don't need actual routing.
 *
 * Use this when you want to verify navigation calls without actual routing behavior.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const routerSpy = createRouterSpy();
 * TestBed.configureTestingModule({
 *   providers: [{ provide: Router, useValue: routerSpy }]
 * });
 *
 * // Later in test:
 * expect(routerSpy.navigate).toHaveBeenCalledWith(['/dashboard']);
 * ```
 */
export function createRouterSpy() {
  return jasmine.createSpyObj('Router', ['navigate', 'navigateByUrl']);
}

/**
 * Common test routes for integration tests.
 *
 * Use these routes when testing navigation flows or route guards.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { RouterTestingModule } from '@angular/router/testing';
 *
 * TestBed.configureTestingModule({
 *   imports: [RouterTestingModule.withRoutes(TEST_ROUTES)]
 * });
 * ```
 */
export const TEST_ROUTES = [
  // Auth routes
  { path: 'auth/login', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'auth/register', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'auth/owner-register', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'auth/verify-email', component: {} as any },

  // Owner portal routes
  { path: 'owner/dashboard', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'owner/profile', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'owner/settings', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'owner/users', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'owner/reports', component: {} as any },

  // Student routes
  { path: 'student/dashboard', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'student/discovery', component: {} as any },
  { path: 'student/bookings', component: {} as any },

  // Root
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/auth/login', pathMatch: 'full' }
];
```

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References
None required - implementation completed without issues

### Completion Notes List

**Validation Component Used:**
- Successfully refactored `RegisterComponent` tests (studymate-frontend/src/app/features/auth/register.component.spec.ts)
- Replaced `RouterTestingModule` with `provideRouterMock()` utility (Pattern 1)
- All 11 RegisterComponent tests pass successfully
- Simplified test setup by removing deprecated RouterTestingModule

**Testing Results:**
- Router test utilities: 100% test coverage (16/16 tests passing)
- RegisterComponent validation: All tests passing with utilities
- Full test suite: No regressions introduced (225 tests passing, 23 pre-existing failures unrelated to this story)

**Utility Function Performance:**
- `provideRouterMock()`: Works perfectly for components with RouterLink directives
- `createRouterSpy()`: Validated pattern but not used in final refactoring (Pattern 1 was more appropriate)
- `TEST_ROUTES`: Includes 13 routes covering auth, owner portal, student portal, and root redirect

**Documentation Quality:**
- Comprehensive router-mocking-patterns.md created with 3 patterns, examples, and troubleshooting
- Testing strategy documentation updated with Router Test Utilities section
- Coding standards updated with Router testing pattern examples
- All documentation cross-referenced for discoverability

**Key Insights:**
- Pattern 1 (provideRouterMock) is ideal for most component tests with RouterLink
- Pattern 3 (createRouterSpy) is better for testing navigation logic specifically
- Angular 20's `provideRouter()` is recommended over deprecated `RouterTestingModule`
- context7 MCP confirmed Angular 20 router testing best practices

**Recommendations for Future Stories:**
- Stories 1.15-1.21 can now use these utilities immediately
- Pattern 1 recommended for most header/footer/layout components
- Pattern 2 recommended for route guard testing
