## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Story 1.14a** must complete before ANY routing work (Stories 1.15-1.17)
2. **Story 1.2.1** fixes OwnerRegisterComponent tests (can run after Story 1.14a, benefits from Story 1.14b utilities)
3. **Story 1.14b** creates reusable Router test utilities (enables efficient testing in Stories 1.15-1.21)
4. **Story 1.17** must complete before implementing feature pages (Stories 1.1-1.14, 1.18, 1.20)
5. Backend stories can run in parallel with frontend when appropriate

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Frontend + Backend pairs can run simultaneously
- Multiple frontend stories can run in parallel after layout shell complete
- Testing story (1.99) can start once all APIs implemented

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Path & Blockers

### Hard Blockers (Cannot proceed without these)
1. **Story 1.14a** ‚Üê All routing work depends on this
2. **Story 1.17** ‚Üê All feature pages depend on this

### Soft Dependencies (Nice to have, not blocking)
- Backend APIs can complete before frontend pages start
- Frontend pages need backend APIs to test end-to-end
- Story 1.99 should wait until all APIs are complete

---

## üéØ Sprint Capacity Planning

### Assumptions
- **Team Size:** 2 Frontend Devs + 1 Backend Dev + 1 QA
- **Sprint Length:** 2 weeks
- **Team Velocity:** 25-30 SP per sprint
- **Working Days:** 10 days per sprint

### Sprint Breakdown

| Sprint | Story Points | Stories Completed | Key Deliverables |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Sprint N** | 23 SP | 1.14a, 1.2.1, 1.14b, 1.15, 1.16, 1.15.1, 1.16.1, 1.17 | Test fixes, utilities, layout infrastructure, design system alignment |
| **Sprint N+1** | 26 SP | 1.1-1.6 + backends | Dashboard & Seat Mgmt |
| **Sprint N+2** | 28 SP | 1.7-1.11, 1.18-1.19 | User Mgmt & Profile |
| **Sprint N+3** | 31 SP | 1.12-1.14, 1.20-1.21, 1.99 | Reports, Settings, Validation |
| **Total** | **108 SP** | **31 stories** | **Complete Epic-1** |

---

## üìä Risk Management

### High Risk Items
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Story 1.14a takes longer than expected | Medium | High | Allocate extra time; start immediately |
| Story 1.17 routing complexity | Medium | High | Use proven patterns from Epic 2; context7 MCP |
| Backend API delays | Medium | Medium | Start backend stories early; parallel development |
| Report generation (PDF/Excel) complexity | High | Medium | Allocate 8 SP; use established libraries |
| Integration issues between stories | Low | Medium | Regular integration testing; Story 1.99 validation |

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Start blockers early:** Stories 1.14a and 1.17 in Sprint N
2. **Parallel development:** Backend + Frontend simultaneously
3. **Regular integration:** Test layout integration after each story
4. **Buffer time:** Add 10% buffer for unexpected issues
5. **Daily standups:** Identify blockers early

## üìù Notes for Scrum Master

### Sprint Planning Recommendations
1. **Sprint N:** Focus on infrastructure (1.14a-1.17) - Critical path
2. **Sprint N+1:** Max parallelization (dashboard + seat management)
3. **Sprint N+2:** User management can be split if needed
4. **Sprint N+3:** Reports are complex - don't underestimate

### Team Assignment Suggestions
- **Frontend Dev 1:** Dashboard, Metrics, User Management
- **Frontend Dev 2:** Seat Map, Editor, Profile, Settings
- **Backend Dev:** All backend stories + assist with integration
- **QA:** Story 1.99 validation + ongoing testing

### Velocity Monitoring
- Track actual vs estimated story points
- Adjust future sprint planning based on velocity
- If velocity drops, consider reducing scope or extending timeline

---

## üöÄ Quick Reference: "What Can I Work On Now?"

### If Story 1.14a is NOT complete:
- ‚õî Cannot start: 1.15, 1.16, 1.17 (routing depends on tests)
- ‚õî Cannot start: 1.2.1, 1.14b (require 1.14a fixes first)
- ‚úÖ Can start: All backend stories (1.1-backend, 1.4-backend, 1.7-backend, etc.)

### If Story 1.14a IS complete:
- ‚úÖ Can start: 1.2.1 (Fix OwnerRegisterComponent tests - quick win)
- ‚úÖ Can start: 1.14b (Create Router test utilities)
- ‚úÖ Recommended: Do 1.2.1 + 1.14b before 1.15-1.17 for test infrastructure

### If Story 1.17 is NOT complete:
- ‚õî Cannot start: Any frontend feature pages
- ‚úÖ Can start: All backend APIs

### If Story 1.17 IS complete:
- ‚úÖ Can start: ALL frontend feature stories (1.1-1.14, 1.18, 1.20)
- ‚úÖ Prioritize: Dashboard (1.1-1.3) first for demo value

### Anytime:
- ‚úÖ Backend stories can always run ahead of frontend
- ‚úÖ Story 1.99 starts when all APIs complete
