## Dev Notes

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Layout Integration (Added 2025-10-12)

**This story component must render within the Owner Portal Layout Shell (Story 1.17).**

**Key Points:**
- This component should **NOT** include its own header, footer, or navigation
- It should be a **content-only component** that renders in the `<router-outlet>` of the Layout Shell
- After Story 1.17 is complete, this dashboard will automatically display with:
  - ✅ Header with navigation (Story 1.15)
  - ✅ Footer (Story 1.16)
  - ✅ Route protection (AuthGuard, RoleGuard)

**Integration Requirements:**
1. Component should only contain dashboard-specific content (metrics, seat map, charts)
2. Remove any custom header/navigation if present
3. Ensure routing is configured as child route under `/owner` parent
4. Route path should be `dashboard` (not `/owner/dashboard`)

**Testing After Layout Integration:**
- Navigate to `/owner/dashboard` and verify header/footer display
- Verify navigation links in header work correctly
- Ensure no layout conflicts or duplicate elements
- Validate responsive behavior with layout shell

**Reference:** See Stories 1.15-1.17 for Owner Portal infrastructure implementation.

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists. This is the first story in Epic 1.

### Architecture Overview
[Source: docs/architecture/studymate-system-architecture-blueprint.md#1-technology-stack--environment]
- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with TypeScript, NgRx (State Management), Signals
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.5.6 (Java 17)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (DB: `studymate_user`, Credentials: user=`studymate_user`, pwd=`studymate_user`)

### Angular Development Standards
[Source: docs/guidelines/coding-standard-guidelines/angular-rules.md]
- Use standalone components with `inject()` function for service injection
- Implement Angular Signals for reactive state management
- Follow kebab-case naming for files (e.g., `owner-dashboard.component.ts`)
- Use 2-space indentation and single quotes for strings
- Utilize `async` pipe for observables in templates
- Implement lazy loading for feature modules
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for image optimization
- Apply trackBy functions with `ngFor` for performance
- Import order: Angular core → RxJS → Angular-specific → App core → Shared → Environment → Relative paths

### UI/UX Design Standards
[Source: docs/guidelines/airbnb-inspired-design-system.md]
- **Color Palette Structure**: Primary (10%), Secondary/Accent (30%), Neutral (60%), Semantic colors for status
- **Color Layering**: Create 3-4 shades of base colors for depth (darkest for backgrounds, lightest for active states)
- **Shadow System**: Use two-layer shadows (light top glow + dark bottom shadow) for depth
  - Small shadow: Subtle elements, nav items, tabs
  - Medium shadow: Cards, dropdowns, modals (default)
  - Large shadow: Hover states, focused elements
- **60-30-10 Rule**: 60% neutral colors, 30% secondary colors, 10% primary accent color

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/studymate-system-architecture-blueprint.md#3-core-data-model-postgresql-schema]

**`study_halls` table:**
- `id` (PK)
- `owner_id` (FK to users)
- `hall_name`
- `seat_count`

**`seats` table:**
- `id` (PK)
- `hall_id` (FK to study_halls)
- `seat_number`
- `x_coord` (coordinate for seat map visualization)
- `y_coord` (coordinate for seat map visualization)
- `status` (available, occupied, reserved)

**Dashboard Metrics Interface (TypeScript):**
```typescript
interface DashboardMetrics {
  totalSeats: number;
  occupancyPercentage: number;
  currentRevenue: number;
  seatMap: SeatStatus[];
}

interface SeatStatus {
  id: string;
  seatNumber: string;
  xCoord: number;
  yCoord: number;
  status: 'available' | 'occupied' | 'reserved';
}
```

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1: Display Total Seats, Occupancy %, and Current Revenue**
- **Given**: I am an authenticated Owner viewing my dashboard
- **When**: I navigate to `/owner/dashboard/:hallId`
- **Then**: I see Total Seats, Occupancy %, and Current Revenue in metric cards
- **Evidence**:
  - Implementation: owner-dashboard.ts:27-40 (computed signals), owner-dashboard.html:28-48 (UI)
  - Unit Tests: owner-dashboard.spec.ts:67-75, 99-116
  - E2E Tests: owner-dashboard.spec.ts:45-60
- **Status**: ✓ FULLY COVERED

**AC2: Show graphical, real-time seat map occupancy**
- **Given**: I am viewing the dashboard with seat data
- **When**: The seat map section loads
- **Then**: I see a graphical representation with color-coded seats (green=available, red=occupied, orange=reserved)
- **Evidence**:
  - Implementation: seat-map.ts (SVG component), seat-map.html:26-66 (SVG rendering)
  - Unit Tests: seat-map.spec.ts:54-134 (comprehensive component testing)

- **Status**: ✓ FULLY COVERED

### Security Review

**Status**: ✓ PASS

**Findings:**
- ✓ No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- ✓ Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- ✓ Route protected by authGuard and roleGuard (app.routes.ts:62)
- ✓ API endpoints follow RESTful conventions

### Performance Considerations

**Status**: ✓ PASS with MINOR OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITY

**Current Performance:**
- ✓ Lazy loading configured for dashboard route
- ✓ SVG-based seat map is lightweight
- ✓ Signals provide efficient change detection
- ✓ Computed values prevent unnecessary recalculations

**Minor Optimization Opportunity (LOW PRIORITY):**
- Seat map dimensions are computed on every coordinate change (seat-map.ts:17-27)
- For halls with >100 seats, consider memoization
- **Decision**: Current implementation is acceptable for MVP. Optimize only if performance metrics indicate a need
