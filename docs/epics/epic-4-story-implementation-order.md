## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Epic 0.1 (Authentication)** - MUST be complete for owner JWT tokens
2. **Story 4.1-backend** must complete before Story 4.1 (Frontend)
3. **Story 1.17 (Owner Portal Layout)** required for navigation structure
4. Backend stories should complete before corresponding frontend stories
5. Story 4.99 (API Validation) runs after all backend APIs complete

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Frontend + Backend pairs can run simultaneously once dependencies met
- Stories 4.6-4.9 (Contact Support) can run in parallel with announcements
- Story 4.5 (Notifications) can be deferred as optional enhancement

## 🔀 Detailed Execution Flow (Sequence Diagram)

```
SPRINT M (Weeks 1-2)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Week 1:
  Day 1-3:  [4.1-backend: Announcement APIs] ← BLOCKER
  Day 4-5:  [4.1: Creation Interface] ← Depends on 4.1-backend

Week 2:
  Day 1-2:  [4.2: Publishing Service] ∥ [4.3: Student Display] ← Parallel

  ✓ Checkpoint: Announcement core workflow complete
  ✓ Checkpoint: Owners can create, students can view

SPRINT M+1 (Weeks 3-4)

## ⚠️ Critical Path & Blockers

### Hard Blockers (Cannot proceed without these)
1. **Epic 0.1 (Authentication)** ← Required for owner JWT tokens
2. **Story 1.17 (Owner Portal Layout)** ← Required for navigation
3. **Story 4.1-backend** ← Story 4.1 depends on this

### Soft Dependencies (Nice to have, not blocking)
- Story 4.5 is optional enhancement (notifications)
- Story 4.10 is optional (support history view)
- Story 4.99 should wait until all APIs are complete

---

## 🎯 Sprint Capacity Planning

### Assumptions
- **Team Size:** 2 Frontend Devs + 1 Backend Dev + 1 QA
- **Sprint Length:** 2 weeks
- **Team Velocity:** 25-30 SP per sprint
- **Working Days:** 10 days per sprint

### Sprint Breakdown

| Sprint | Story Points | Stories Completed | Key Deliverables |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Sprint M** | 18 SP | 4.1-backend, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 | Announcement creation & display |
| **Sprint M+1** | 24 SP | 4.4, 4.6-4.10 | History mgmt, contact support |
| **Sprint M+2** | 16 SP | 4.5 (optional), 4.99 | Notifications, validation |
| **Total** | **58 SP** | **12 stories** | **Complete Epic-4** |

## 📊 Risk Management

### High Risk Items
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Story 4.1-backend delays Story 4.1 | Medium | High | Start backend early; prioritize in Sprint M |
| Rich text editor integration complexity | Medium | Medium | Use proven libraries (Quill/CKEditor); allocate extra time |
| Real-time notification system (4.5) | High | Low | Mark as optional; can defer post-MVP |
| Email notification service setup | Medium | Medium | Use existing email service; test early |
| Support ticket spam/abuse | Low | Medium | Implement rate limiting; captcha |

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Start blockers early:** Story 4.1-backend in Sprint M Day 1
2. **Parallel development:** Contact support independent from announcements
3. **Optional features:** Story 4.5 can be deferred if capacity tight
4. **Regular integration:** Test announcement workflow after each story
5. **Buffer time:** Add 10% buffer for unexpected issues

## 📝 Notes for Scrum Master

### Sprint Planning Recommendations
1. **Sprint M:** Focus on announcement core (4.1-backend → 4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3)
2. **Sprint M+1:** Parallel tracks (announcements + support)
3. **Sprint M+2:** Optional enhancement (4.5) - defer if needed

### Team Assignment Suggestions
- **Frontend Dev 1:** Announcement features (4.1, 4.2, 4.4)
- **Frontend Dev 2:** Student view + Support (4.3, 4.6-4.8, 4.10)
- **Backend Dev:** APIs (4.1-backend, 4.9) + assist with 4.5
- **QA:** Story 4.99 validation + ongoing testing

### Velocity Monitoring
- Track actual vs estimated story points
- Story 4.1 draft is complete - ready for implementation
- If Story 4.5 (Notifications) is deferred, total SP drops to ~50 SP
