## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 1.2 (Seat Map Configuration)** created the seat data:
- Seats stored with x_coord, y_coord (pixel positions on 800×600 canvas)
- Seat status: 'available', 'booked', 'locked', 'maintenance'
- Seat numbers stored in seat_number column (unique per hall)
- Grid snapping used (50px grid) for organized placement
- Origin (0,0) at top-left corner

**Key Learning:** Story 1.3 visualizes the seats created in Story 1.2. Coordinate system and canvas dimensions must match Story 1.2 specifications.

### Architecture Overview

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with TypeScript, Signals, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.5.6 with Java 17 (API to be created)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (`studymate` database)
- **State Management**: Angular Signals for component state

### Database Schema

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#5-seats]

**seats table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE seats (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    hall_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES study_halls(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    seat_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    x_coord INT NOT NULL,
    y_coord INT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'available',
    custom_price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    locked_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    locked_at TIMESTAMP,
    lock_expiry TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(hall_id, seat_number)
);
```

**Status Values:**
- `available`: Green (#10B981)
- `booked`: Red (#EF4444)
- `locked`: Yellow (#F59E0B)
- `maintenance`: Gray (#6B7280)

[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#4-study_halls]

**study_halls table:**
- `seat_count` field tracks total number of seats
- Used for occupancy percentage calculation

### Angular Development Standards

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#angular--typescript-standards]
- Use standalone components with `inject()` function
- Implement Angular Signals for reactive state
- Follow kebab-case naming for files
- Use 2-space indentation
- Import order: Angular core → RxJS → Angular-specific → App core → Shared

### Seat Map Rendering Approach

[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Recommended Approach:** SVG-based rendering for scalability and interactivity

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-seat-map-view',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
  template: `
    <svg [attr.viewBox]="viewBox" class="seat-map-svg">
      @for (seat of seats(); track seat.id) {
        <g [attr.transform]="'translate(' + seat.xCoord + ',' + seat.yCoord + ')'">
          <rect
            width="40"
            height="40"
            [attr.fill]="getSeatColor(seat.status)"
            class="seat"
          />
          <text x="20" y="25" text-anchor="middle" class="seat-number">
            {{ seat.seatNumber }}
          </text>
        </g>
      }
    </svg>
  `
})
export class SeatMapViewComponent {
  private seatMapService = inject(SeatMapService);

  seats = signal<Seat[]>([]);
  viewBox = '0 0 800 600';

  // Computed metrics
  totalSeats = computed(() => this.seats().length);
  bookedSeats = computed(() =>
    this.seats().filter(s => s.status === 'booked').length
  );
  occupancyPercent = computed(() => {
    const total = this.totalSeats();
    return total > 0 ? (this.bookedSeats() / total * 100).toFixed(1) : '0.0';
  });

  getSeatColor(status: string): string {
    const colors = {
      available: '#10B981',
      booked: '#EF4444',
      locked: '#F59E0B',
      maintenance: '#6B7280'
    };
    return colors[status] || colors.available;
  }
}
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Unit Testing
- **Framework**: Jasmine/Karma
- **Coverage**: 90%+ required
- **Focus**: Seat rendering logic, status color mapping, occupancy calculations, API integration

#### E2E Testing
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Requirements**:
  - Test complete seat map visualization workflow
  - Verify seats render at correct positions
  - Test status color display
  - Verify occupancy metrics accuracy
  - Verify zero browser console errors/warnings

#### PostgreSQL MCP Validation (MANDATORY)
- **Database**: `studymate`
- **User**: `studymate_user`
- **Validation**:
  - Verify seats table data matches visualization
  - Query seat status distribution
  - Validate occupancy calculations against database
  - Check seat coordinates

### context7 MCP Integration (MANDATORY)

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]
- **Pre-Implementation**: Consult context7 for Angular 20 SVG rendering patterns
- **Required Queries**:
  - `"use context7 - Angular 20 SVG rendering and manipulation"`
  - `"use context7 - Angular 20 signals computed values"`
  - `"use context7 - Angular 20 polling and real-time updates"`

### UI/UX Design Standards

[Source: docs/guidelines/airbnb-inspired-design-system/index.md]
- Use defined color palette for seat statuses
- Apply shadow system for visual depth
- Ensure clear visual hierarchy
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Maintain 60-30-10 color rule
- Provide clear status legend

### Real-Time Updates Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#real-time-communication]

**Phase 1 (Current Story):** Polling approach
- Poll every 10 seconds for seat status updates
- Use RxJS interval with switchMap for API calls
- Optimize to only update changed seats

**Phase 2 (Future):** WebSocket integration
- Real-time seat status push from backend
- Immediate status updates without polling
- More efficient for high-traffic scenarios

### Project Structure Notes

Story 1.3 integrates into Owner Dashboard (Story 1.1). Component should be placed within dashboard feature directory and imported into dashboard page component.

### Future Enhancements

**From QA Review (CODE-002):**
- **Centralized Logging Service**: Implement a production-grade logging service to replace direct `console.error()` usage
  - **Location**: `seat-map-view.ts:83` (currently uses `console.error`)
  - **Priority**: Low (future enhancement)
  - **Benefits**: Structured error tracking, production monitoring, log aggregation support
  - **Recommended Approach**: Create `LoggingService` in `src/app/core/services/` with methods for error, warn, info, debug levels
  - **Related**: See QA gate file `docs/qa/gates/1.3-seat-map-visualization.yml` CODE-002

**Polling Improvements:**
- Add exponential backoff retry logic for failed polling attempts
- Consider circuit breaker pattern for persistent API failures
- Add online/offline detection to pause/resume polling intelligently

**Real-Time Communication:**
- WebSocket integration for true real-time seat status updates (already in roadmap - Phase 2)

- ✅ **Project Structure**: Files correctly placed in feature/dashboard structure
- ✅ **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit and E2E test coverage with proper mocking
- ✅ **Accessibility**: SVG includes title elements for screen readers, semantic HTML structure
- ✅ **All ACs Met**: Yes - All 3 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Issues Identified

#### CODE-001: Method Visibility Issue (Medium)
- **Finding**: `loadSeatsWithPolling()` is declared private but called from template retry button (line 34 of HTML)
- **Location**: `seat-map-view.ts:71`, `seat-map-view.html:34`
- **Impact**: Will cause runtime error when retry button is clicked
- **Recommendation**: Change method to public or create a separate public `retry()` method
- **Owner**: Dev

#### CODE-002: Direct Console.error Usage (Low)
- **Finding**: Component uses `console.error()` directly instead of a logging service
- **Location**: `seat-map-view.ts:83`
- **Impact**: Low - no structured logging in production for error tracking/monitoring
- **Recommendation**: Consider implementing a centralized LoggingService for production deployments
- **Owner**: Dev (future enhancement)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CODE-001**: Fix `loadSeatsWithPolling()` method visibility (MUST FIX before production)
- [ ] **CODE-002**: Implement centralized logging service (nice-to-have)
- [ ] Consider adding exponential backoff for polling error recovery (future enhancement)
- [ ] WebSocket integration for true real-time updates (already in roadmap)

### Security Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

- ✅ No authentication/authorization vulnerabilities found
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- ✅ API endpoint `/owner/seats/{hallId}` requires owner role authentication
- ✅ No XSS vulnerabilities in SVG rendering (Angular sanitization active)
- ✅ No CSRF concerns (read-only GET operations)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ✅ PASS**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ SVG rendering is lightweight and scales well
- ✅ Polling interval (10s) is reasonable and won't overload server
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile viewport optimizations
- ✅ Computed signals automatically optimize re-calculations
- ✅ RxJS `switchMap` prevents request pileup

**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing request debouncing if users report performance issues
- WebSocket migration (future) will eliminate polling overhead entirely

### Reliability Assessment

**Status: ⚠️ CONCERNS**

**Current State:**
- ✅ Error handling present for API failures
- ✅ Proper subscription cleanup on component destroy
- ⚠️ Limited error recovery - polling stops on first error

**Recommendations:**
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Consider circuit breaker pattern for persistent API failures
- Add online/offline detection to pause/resume polling

### Files Modified During Review

**None** - No refactoring was necessary. The implementation was already of high quality.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** CONCERNS → `docs/qa/gates/1.3-seat-map-visualization.yml`

**Quality Score:** 90/100

**Gate Decision Rationale:**
- The implementation is excellent with strong test coverage and clean architecture
- One medium-severity issue (method visibility) requires fixing before production
- Reliability could be enhanced with better error recovery, but current implementation is acceptable for MVP
- Overall: High-quality work that demonstrates mastery of Angular 20 patterns

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Changes Required** - Address CODE-001 (method visibility) before moving to Done

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix `loadSeatsWithPolling()` visibility issue (required)
2. Optionally: Implement logging service and retry logic (nice-to-have)
3. Re-run unit tests to verify fix
4. Update File List with any changes
5. Move to Done status

**Note:** This is excellent work! The CONCERNS gate is solely due to the method visibility bug that will cause a runtime error. Once fixed, this story is production-ready.
