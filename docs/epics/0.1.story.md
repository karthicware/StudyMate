## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists. This is the **first story in Epic 0** - the foundation epic. This story establishes the Angular frontend project that all future frontend development will build upon.

### Architecture Overview
[Source: docs/architecture/studymate-system-architecture-blueprint.md#1-technology-stack--environment]
- **Frontend Framework**: Angular 20 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: NgRx with Signals (to be added in Story 0.3)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (to be added in Story 0.2)
- **Build Tool**: Angular CLI
- **Package Manager**: npm

### Angular 20 Project Setup Standards
[Source: docs/guidelines/coding-standard-guidelines/angular-rules.md]
- **Standalone Components**: Use standalone components as default (no NgModules)
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enable strict type checking for reliability
- **File Naming**: kebab-case for all files (e.g., `user-profile.component.ts`)
- **Import Order**: Angular core → RxJS → Angular-specific → App core → Shared → Environment → Relative paths

### Project Structure
Standard Angular project structure with feature-based organization:
