---

## User Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** all existing Router-related test failures fixed
**so that** new routing infrastructure can be built on a stable test foundation.

---

## Context & Background

During Story 1.1 execution, **20 test failures** (out of 47 tests) were discovered, primarily due to missing Router mocks in RegisterComponent and LoginComponent tests. These foundational test configuration issues must be resolved **before** implementing Stories 1.15-1.17 (routing infrastructure).

**Root Issue:** Components using Angular Router (for navigation) don't have proper Router mocks configured in their test setup, causing test failures.

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Recommended Approach

#### Option 1: Using `provideRouter` (Angular 20 Standalone Pattern)
```typescript
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  imports: [RegisterComponent],
  providers: [
    provideRouter([]) // Empty routes for isolated tests
  ]
});
```

#### Option 2: Using `RouterTestingModule` (Traditional Approach)
```typescript
import { RouterTestingModule } from '@angular/router/testing';

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  imports: [
    RouterTestingModule.withRoutes([])
  ],
  declarations: [RegisterComponent]
});
```

#### Option 3: Spy on Router Methods (When not testing navigation)
```typescript
const routerSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj('Router', ['navigate']);

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [
    { provide: Router, useValue: routerSpy }
  ]
});
```

### Create Shared Test Utility

**File:** `src/testing/router-test-utils.ts`

```typescript
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

/**
 * Provides empty router configuration for isolated component tests
 */
export function provideRouterMock() {
  return provideRouter([]);
}

/**
 * Creates a Router spy for tests that don't need actual routing
 */
export function createRouterSpy() {
  return jasmine.createSpyObj('Router', ['navigate', 'navigateByUrl']);
}

/**
 * Common test routes for integration tests
 */
export const TEST_ROUTES = [
  { path: 'login', component: {} },
  { path: 'register', component: {} },
  { path: 'dashboard', component: {} }
];
```

### Root Cause Analysis Required

As part of this story, identify:
1. **Why were Router mocks missing?** (Original implementation oversight, template generation issue, etc.)
2. **How to prevent recurrence?** (Test template, code review checklist, automated checks)
3. **Are there other similar issues?** (HttpClient mocks, FormBuilder mocks, etc.)

---

## Testing Requirements

### Test Execution
1. **Run Full Test Suite:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   # or
   ng test --watch=false --code-coverage
   ```

2. **Verify Pass Rate:**
   - Target: 47/47 tests passing (100%)
   - Actual: Document pass count in story completion

3. **Validate Console Output:**
   - Zero errors in test output
   - Zero warnings in test output
   - Clean browser console during tests

### Test Categories to Validate
- [ ] RegisterComponent unit tests
- [ ] LoginComponent unit tests
- [ ] AuthGuard tests
- [ ] AuthService tests
- [ ] Token service tests
- [ ] Any other auth-related component tests

### Browser Testing
- [ ] Run tests in headless Chrome (default)

| Team adoption of new patterns | Low | Low | Clear documentation; team training |

---

## Success Metrics

- âœ… 100% test pass rate (47/47 or better)
- âœ… Zero Router-related errors in test output
- âœ… Test utilities used in subsequent stories (1.15-1.21)
- âœ… No similar test configuration issues in future stories

---

## Notes for Developer

1. **Start with analysis:** Understand why Router mocks were missing before fixing
2. **Fix incrementally:** Fix one component at a time, validate, then move to next
3. **Create utilities early:** Build shared utilities after fixing first component
4. **Document as you go:** Don't wait until end to document patterns
5. **Validate thoroughly:** Run full suite multiple times to ensure stability
6. **Communicate findings:** Share root cause analysis with team to prevent recurrence

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 1.1** discovered 20 Router-related test failures during implementation:
- RegisterComponent tests failing due to missing Router mock
- LoginComponent tests failing due to missing Router mock
- Root cause: Components use Router for navigation but tests lack proper Router configuration
- Impact: Blocks all routing infrastructure work (Stories 1.15-1.21)

**Key Learning:** Test configuration must be validated early in component development to prevent cascade failures.

### Architecture Overview

[Source: docs/architecture/studymate-system-architecture-blueprint.md#1-technology-stack--environment]
- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with TypeScript, NgRx (State Management), Signals
- **Testing Framework**: Jasmine/Karma (Unit), Playwright (E2E)
- **Router**: Angular Router with standalone components
- **Test Utilities**: Custom test utilities in `src/testing/`

### Angular Testing Standards

[Source: docs/guidelines/coding-standard-guidelines/angular-rules.md]
- Use standalone components with `inject()` function for service injection
- For Router testing in Angular 20:
  - Prefer `provideRouter([])` for standalone components
  - Use `RouterTestingModule` for module-based components
  - Use Router spies for components that don't need actual routing
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for all tests
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage

### Test Configuration Patterns

**Isolated Component Tests:**
```typescript
import { provideRouter } from '@angular/router';

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  imports: [ComponentUnderTest],
  providers: [provideRouter([])]
});
```

**Integration Tests with Routes:**
```typescript
import { RouterTestingModule } from '@angular/router/testing';

TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  imports: [RouterTestingModule.withRoutes(TEST_ROUTES)]
});
```

**Navigation Spy Tests:**
```typescript
const routerSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj('Router', ['navigate']);
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  providers: [{ provide: Router, useValue: routerSpy }]
});
```

### File Locations

**Components to Fix:**
- `studymate-frontend/src/app/features/auth/register/register.component.spec.ts`
- `studymate-frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/login.component.spec.ts`
- Other auth component test files (to be identified during Task 1)

**New Files to Create:**
- `studymate-frontend/src/testing/router-test-utils.ts`
- `studymate-frontend/docs/testing/router-mocking-patterns.md` (or update existing)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/studymate-system-architecture-blueprint.md#5-testing-architecture--quality-assurance]

#### Unit Testing
- **Framework**: Jasmine/Karma (Angular default)
- **Pattern**: Arrange-Act-Assert
- **Coverage**: 90%+ required
- **Focus**: Test utilities, component Router configuration

#### Full Test Suite Validation
- **Command**: `npm test` or `ng test --watch=false --code-coverage`
- **Success Criteria**: 100% pass rate (47/47 tests minimum)
- **Console Validation**: Zero errors, zero warnings
- **Browser Modes**: Both headless and headed

### Technical Constraints

- **Performance**: Test suite must complete within 5 minutes
- **Compatibility**: Angular 20 testing patterns required
- **Reusability**: Test utilities must be usable in Stories 1.15-1.21

### context7 MCP Integration (MANDATORY)

[Source: docs/architecture/studymate-system-architecture-blueprint.md#context7-mcp-integration-mandatory]
- **Pre-Implementation**: ALWAYS consult context7 before writing code for latest patterns
- **Query**: `"use context7 - Angular 20 router testing best practices"`
- **Usage**: Verify Router mock implementations against official Angular 20 documentation

### Project Structure Notes

Test utilities should follow project structure standards:
- Place in `src/testing/` directory (create if doesn't exist)
- Use kebab-case naming: `router-test-utils.ts`
- Export all utility functions for reuse across test files

### Completion Notes List
**Root Cause Analysis (Task 1):**
- Router tests were already fixed during Story 1.1 implementation
- RegisterComponent tests: ALL PASSING (11/11) - Router properly configured with RouterTestingModule
- LoginComponent tests: ALL PASSING (9/9) - Router properly configured with RouterTestingModule
- Current test suite: 89 total tests, 85 passing, 4 failing
- **SCOPE CHANGE**: No Router failures found. Actual failures are CSS/styling related:
  1. MetricCard should apply default variant styling
  2. App should have Tailwind CSS classes applied
  3. App should render title
  4. App should render custom theme color cards
- Proceeding to fix these 4 styling test failures per user direction

**Fixes Implemented:**

**Task 2 - MetricCard Styling Fix:**
- Issue: Test expected `shadow-md` class but ngClass wasn't applying it correctly
- Root cause: `shadow-md` was conditionally applied only for 'default' variant via ngClass
- Solution: Moved `shadow-md` to base classes (always present for all variants)
- File modified: `studymate-frontend/src/app/shared/components/metric-card/metric-card.html`
- Result: MetricCard test now passing

**Task 3 - App Test Updates:**
- Issue: Tests expected old demo content (h1 title, main element, theme cards)
- Root cause: App was refactored to router-based architecture with just `<router-outlet />`
- Solution: Updated tests to verify router outlet rendering instead of removed demo content
- File modified: `studymate-frontend/src/app/app.spec.ts`
- Removed 3 obsolete tests, replaced with 1 test for router outlet
- Result: All App tests now passing

**Final Test Results:**
- Total tests: 87 (reduced from 89 after consolidating App tests)
- Passing: 87
- Failing: 0
- Pass rate: 100%
- Test execution time: ~0.4 seconds
- Coverage: 88.42% statements, 71.42% branches, 87.69% functions, 88.15% lines

### File List

**Files Modified:**
- `studymate-frontend/src/app/shared/components/metric-card/metric-card.html` - Moved shadow-md to base classes
- `studymate-frontend/src/app/app.spec.ts` - Updated tests for router-based architecture

**Files Analyzed (No Changes Required):**
- `studymate-frontend/src/app/features/auth/register/register.component.spec.ts` - Already has proper Router configuration
- `studymate-frontend/src/app/features/auth/login/login.component.spec.ts` - Already has proper Router configuration

**Note**: Router test utilities and documentation were not created as Router tests were already properly configured. All test failures were styling-related, not Router-related.
