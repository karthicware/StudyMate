## Test Execution Results

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Tests:** 49
- **Passed:** 37 (75.5%)
- **Failed:** 12 (24.5%)
- **Duration:** 36.4 seconds

### Test Files Executed
1. `owner-registration-gender.spec.ts` - 16 tests (10 passed, 6 failed)
2. `student-registration-gender.spec.ts` - 13 tests (8 passed, 5 failed)
3. `registration-accessibility.spec.ts` - 20 tests (19 passed, 1 failed)

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Category 1: Form Submission Tests (4 failures)

**Issue:** Timeout waiting for API request completion

**Failing Tests:**
1. ✗ Owner Registration › should register owner with gender selected (12.3s timeout)
2. ✗ Owner Registration › should register owner without gender (12.2s timeout)
3. ✗ Student Registration › should register student with gender selected (12.3s timeout)
4. ✗ Student Registration › should register student without gender (12.2s timeout)

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// Timeout waiting for API request
TimeoutError: page.waitForRequest: Timeout 30000ms exceeded.
Waiting for request /api/v1/auth/register/owner POST
```

**Analysis:**
- Tests are waiting for API requests that never complete
- Possible causes:
  - Form validation preventing submission
  - Frontend not actually calling the API
  - API endpoint mismatch (e.g., `/register/owner` vs `/register`)
  - Network request blocked by CORS or security policy

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Verify form is actually submitting (check for validation errors)
2. Confirm API endpoint URLs match between frontend and test expectations
3. Add debug logging to see what requests are actually being made
4. Consider using `waitForResponse` instead of `waitForRequest` for better debugging

### Category 2: Console Errors (2 failures)

**Issue:** Unexpected console errors on page load

**Failing Tests:**
1. ✗ Owner Registration › should have zero console errors on page load
2. ✗ Student Registration › should have zero console errors on page load

**Error Details:**
```
Error: expect(received).toHaveLength(expected)

Expected length: 0
Received length: 1
Received array: ["Some error message..."]
```

**Analysis:**
- Application is logging errors to console during page load
- Could be legitimate errors that need fixing or expected warnings

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Inspect actual console error messages from test output
2. Determine if errors are legitimate bugs or expected warnings
3. If legitimate: Fix the application bugs
4. If expected: Filter specific warning messages in test or adjust test expectations

### Category 3: Keyboard Navigation (5 failures)

**Issue:** Focus detection and keyboard navigation failures

**Failing Tests:**
1. ✗ Owner Registration › should be keyboard accessible
2. ✗ Owner Accessibility › should be fully keyboard navigable
3. ✗ Owner Accessibility › should be operable with Enter/Space keys
4. ✗ Student Accessibility › should be keyboard navigable
5. ✗ Student Registration › should be keyboard navigable

**Error Example:**
```typescript
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)

Expected: true
Received: false

expect(['gender'].includes(focused!)).toBe(true);
```

**Analysis:**
- Focus detection is not finding the gender field where expected
- Could be due to:
  - Tab order different than expected
  - Elements with different IDs/names than anticipated
  - Form fields that are dynamically rendered or lazy-loaded

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Use Playwright's `page.keyboard.press('Tab')` more carefully with waits
2. Add `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` before keyboard navigation
3. Make focus detection more flexible (check multiple potential field identifiers)
4. Add debug output to see what element is actually focused

### Category 4: Form Validation (1 failure)

**Issue:** Submit button remains disabled when it should be enabled

**Failing Test:**
1. ✗ Student Registration › should maintain gender selection through form validation errors

**Error:**
```
TimeoutError: page.click: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.
- element is not enabled
```

**Analysis:**
- Submit button is disabled because form is invalid
- Test fills only partial form data, causing validation to keep button disabled
- Test intent is to verify gender persists through validation errors, but can't trigger submission

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Fill more form fields to make form valid enough to enable submit button
2. Or: Change test approach to not require clicking disabled button
3. Or: Force click with `{ force: true }` option if testing validation state

## Conclusion

The E2E test infrastructure is successfully established and functional. The 75.5% pass rate demonstrates that the infrastructure works correctly, and the failures are primarily due to:
1. Form submission/API integration issues (fixable)
2. Console error expectations (tunable)
3. Keyboard navigation robustness (improvable)

With focused effort on the identified issues, achieving the 90%+ pass rate target is feasible. The infrastructure foundation is solid and ready for expansion.
