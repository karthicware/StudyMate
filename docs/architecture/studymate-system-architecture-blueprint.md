## 2. High-Level System Architecture

The system utilizes a **3-Tier Architecture** with services decomposed by domain, accessible via a single API Gateway. The architecture supports a **multi-tenant marketplace model** where multiple owners list study halls and students discover/book across all available halls.

**Conceptual Flow:** Clients ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Spring Boot Services ‚Üí PostgreSQL DB

### Core Spring Boot Services

| Core Spring Boot Service | Primary Responsibilities | Technical Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication Service** | Owner/Student registration, login/logout, password reset, JWT token management, session handling. | **NEW in V2**. Utilizes **JWT** with role-based claims (OWNER, STUDENT). Separate login endpoints for owners and students. |
| **Owner Onboarding Service** | Multi-hall management, initial hall setup, location configuration, pricing configuration, hall listing. | **NEW in V2**. Supports owners managing multiple study halls. |
| **Study Hall Discovery Service** | Regional search, Google Maps integration, filtering (price, ratings, availability), hall detail views for students. | **NEW in V2**. Airbnb-style discovery with geospatial queries. |
| **Booking Service** | **Real-time Seat State** management, Seat Locking, Check-in/Check-out across all halls. | **Must be highly consistent** (ACID). **WebSockets** or polling required for real-time FE updates. Supports multi-hall bookings. |
| **Payment & Subscription Service** | Integration with **Razorpay/Stripe**, payment processing, webhook handling, subscription management, auto-reminders. | **Moved to MVP in V2**. Adherence to **PCI compliance** is mandatory. Calculates pricing based on seat/hall configuration. |
| **Reporting & Analytics** | Data aggregation, generating PDF/Excel reports, calculating utilization rates per hall or aggregated across owner's halls. | Can run on a **Read-Replica** for performance isolation. Supports multi-hall reporting. |
| **User Management Service** | Owner-scoped user management (students who booked at owner's halls), staff management, profile management. | Scoped to owner's halls in multi-tenant context. |

- **Version Compatibility**: Verify all dependencies using context7 before installation.
- **Pattern Validation**: Validate implementations against official documentation via context7.

See comprehensive guidelines: [docs/guidelines/context7-mcp.md](../guidelines/context7-mcp.md)

***

## 7. PostgreSQL MCP Integration (MANDATORY)

All database operations, validation, and testing must use PostgreSQL MCP server for direct database access.

### Database Connection Details
- **Database Name**: `studymate`
- **Username**: `studymate_user`
- **Password**: `studymate_user`
- **Access Level**: Full CRUD operations allowed

### Mandatory Usage Scenarios

| Scenario | PostgreSQL MCP Usage | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schema Validation** | Query table structures, constraints, indexes | Verify DB schema matches design specifications. Verify GiST index on latitude/longitude. |
| **Migration Testing** | Execute and validate migration scripts | Ensure zero data loss and schema integrity. Test removal of `users.hall_id` FK. |
| **Data Verification** | Direct SELECT queries to verify data state | Validate acceptance criteria data requirements. Test multi-tenant data isolation. |
| **CRUD Testing** | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations | Test data manipulation logic across all new tables. |
| **Constraint Testing** | Test foreign keys, unique constraints, triggers | Ensure referential integrity across hall_images, hall_reviews, hall_amenities. |
| **Geospatial Query Testing** | Test latitude/longitude queries with distance calculations | Verify student discovery queries return correct results within radius. |
| **Performance Testing** | EXPLAIN queries, index usage analysis | Optimize geospatial queries, verify GiST index usage. |
| **Data Cleanup** | DELETE or TRUNCATE for test data | Maintain clean test environments. |

### Integration with Story Testing
- Every database-related acceptance criterion MUST be validated via PostgreSQL MCP
- All entity/migration stories require PostgreSQL MCP verification before marking as "Done"
- Test reports must include PostgreSQL MCP query results as evidence
- Schema changes must be validated in real-time during development
- **Epic 0.1 Validation**: All authentication tables and JWT token storage validated via MCP
- **Geospatial Validation**: All discovery queries tested with real latitude/longitude data via MCP

### API Validation Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)
**ALL API endpoints MUST be validated using PostgreSQL MCP with dummy data sourced from the database:**

1. **Test Data Setup**: Use PostgreSQL MCP to create all test data (users with roles, study halls with location/pricing, seats with custom pricing, bookings, payments, reviews, amenities)
2. **Database-Sourced Credentials**: Use login credentials from PostgreSQL MCP database for authentication testing (both owner and student accounts)
3. **API Testing**: Test all endpoints with data from database (authentication, onboarding, discovery, booking, payment)
4. **Verification Queries**: Write SQL queries via PostgreSQL MCP to verify API responses match database state
5. **Evidence Capture**: All test results MUST be documented in story files including:
   - SQL queries used for test data setup (including geospatial data)
   - API request/response details (JWT tokens, authentication headers)
   - SQL verification queries and results
   - Screenshots or formatted output as evidence
6. **Validation Stories**: Each Epic must have a dedicated API validation story:
   - Epic 0.1: `0.1.99-api-validation.story.md` (Authentication & Onboarding APIs)
   - Epic 1: `1.99-api-validation.story.md` (Owner Dashboard & Analytics APIs)
   - Epic 2: `2.99-api-validation.story.md` (Student Discovery & Booking APIs)
   - Epic 3: `3.99-api-validation.story.md` (Payment Integration APIs)
   - Epic 4: `4.99-api-validation.story.md` (Communication & Announcement APIs)

### Best Practices
- Use PostgreSQL MCP for immediate feedback during development
- Validate all Spring Data JPA entities against actual database schema
- Test transaction rollback scenarios directly via PostgreSQL MCP
- Monitor database state changes during integration testing
- Create comprehensive test data sets in database before API testing (include multiple owners with multiple halls each)
- Document all SQL queries and API responses as evidence in story files
- Test geospatial queries with varied latitude/longitude coordinates
- Verify GiST index performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE

6. **Phase 6:** Create performance indexes (see Database Indexes section)

**Critical Path:** Authentication Service ‚Üí Owner Onboarding Service ‚Üí Discovery Service ‚Üí Booking/Payment Services

***

## 10. Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with role claims (OWNER, STUDENT)
- **Separate login endpoints** for owners (`/auth/owner/login`) and students (`/auth/student/login`)
- **Password security:** BCrypt hashing with salt rounds = 12
- **Session management:** 24-hour access tokens, optional 30-day refresh tokens
- **Token revocation:** Refresh tokens stored in DB, revocable on logout/password change
- **Password reset:** Time-limited tokens (1 hour), one-time use, stored in `password_reset_tokens`

### Authorization Rules
- **Owner endpoints** (`/owner/**`): Require OWNER role in JWT
- **Student endpoints** (`/student/**`): Require STUDENT role in JWT
- **Discovery endpoints** (`/student/search/**`, `/student/halls/**`): Public or STUDENT role
- **Booking endpoints**: STUDENT role required
- **Payment webhooks**: Signature validation (Razorpay/Stripe HMAC)

### Data Security
- **Multi-tenant isolation:** Owner queries scoped by `owner_id` in JWT
- **SQL injection prevention:** Parameterized queries via Spring Data JPA
- **XSS prevention:** Input sanitization, Content-Security-Policy headers
- **CORS:** Configured for Angular frontend domain only
- **Rate limiting:** Implemented at API Gateway level (TBD)

***

## 11. Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **GiST Index on `study_halls(latitude, longitude)`** for fast geospatial queries (< 100ms for 10k halls)
- **Composite indexes** on frequently queried columns (see Database Indexes section)
- **Connection pooling:** HikariCP with min=10, max=50 connections
- **Read replicas:** Analytics/Reporting service can use read-only replica

### Caching Strategy (Future)
- **Redis cache** for study hall discovery results (TTL: 5 minutes)
- **Cache invalidation:** On hall updates, seat configuration changes
- **JWT token blacklist:** Redis for revoked tokens (only if refresh tokens enabled)

### API Performance Targets
- **Authentication:** Login < 200ms, Registration < 500ms
- **Discovery:** Search < 300ms (with geospatial query), Hall details < 200ms
- **Booking:** Seat lock < 100ms, Booking confirmation < 500ms
- **Payment:** Payment initiation < 300ms, Webhook processing < 1s
- **Real-time updates:** WebSocket latency < 100ms

***

## 12. Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics to Track
- **Authentication:** Login success/failure rates, registration rates, password reset requests
- **Discovery:** Search queries per second, average search latency, popular regions
- **Booking:** Booking conversion rate, seat lock expiration rate, average booking duration
- **Payment:** Payment success rate, payment failure reasons, average payment amount
- **System Health:** Database connection pool usage, API response times, error rates per endpoint

### Logging Strategy
- **Structured logging:** JSON format with correlation IDs
- **Log levels:** INFO for business events, WARN for recoverable errors, ERROR for critical failures
- **Audit trail:** All authentication events, booking/payment transactions
- **PII protection:** Mask sensitive data (passwords, payment details) in logs

### Alerting
- **Critical alerts:** Database down, payment webhook failures, authentication service down
- **Warning alerts:** High error rate (> 5%), slow response times (> 1s), database connection pool exhaustion
