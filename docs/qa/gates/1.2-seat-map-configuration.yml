  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-sensitive operations in frontend. Backend auth will handle authorization."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient use of Angular Signals for reactivity. Grid snapping prevents excessive re-renders. Drag operations smooth and responsive."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages. Graceful degradation when APIs fail (default shifts loaded on error)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component organization, well-documented code, strong type safety. Excellent test coverage (96.61%) ensures maintainability."

backend_api_verification:
  status: "NOT IMPLEMENTED"
  verified_by: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
  verification_date: "2025-10-13"
  findings: |
    Verified backend implementation status by:
    1. Reviewing Story 1.1-Backend (Dashboard API - DONE)
    2. Searching codebase for seat configuration controllers/endpoints
    3. Checking for SeatConfig* files in studymate-backend directory

    Result: Backend APIs for Story 1.2 NOT implemented.

    Story 1.1-Backend implemented:
    - GET /api/v1/owner/dashboard/{hallId} (Dashboard metrics)

    Story 1.2 requires (MISSING):
    - POST /owner/seats/config/{hallId} (Save seat configuration)
    - GET /owner/seats/config/{hallId} (Get seat configuration)
    - DELETE /owner/seats/{hallId}/{seatId} (Delete seat)
    - POST /owner/shifts/config/{hallId} (Save shift configuration)
    - GET /owner/shifts/config/{hallId} (Get shift configuration)

  recommendation: |
    Create Story 1.2-Backend as immediate follow-up to implement required APIs.
    Story 1.2 (Frontend) can be marked Done as all frontend ACs are met.

gate_decision_rationale: |
  This story receives a PASS gate decision based on the following factors:

  STRENGTHS:
  1. Excellent test coverage (96.61%) exceeding the 90% requirement
  2. All acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
  3. Strong adherence to Angular 20 best practices (Signals, standalone components, inject())
  4. Comprehensive E2E testing with zero console errors
  5. Clean code architecture with proper separation of concerns
  6. Good UX with grid snapping, validation feedback, and loading states
  7. Proper error handling throughout the implementation

  ACCEPTABLE LIMITATIONS:
  1. Backend API endpoints not yet implemented - Verified NOT in scope of Story 1.2
     Story 1.2 is frontend-focused; backend APIs require separate Story 1.2-Backend
  2. Mock hallId in use - Documented in Dev Notes, to be replaced when auth integration is complete
  3. Simplified shift configuration (Monday only) - Sufficient for current requirements, easily expandable

  BACKEND API VERIFICATION (2025-10-13):
  - Story 1.1-Backend implemented Dashboard API only (not Seat Configuration APIs)
  - Story 1.2 backend APIs not implemented (0% complete)
  - Frontend properly abstracted and integration-ready via SeatConfigService
  - Graceful error handling when APIs unavailable (default shifts, error messages)

  DECISION RATIONALE:
  Story 1.2 focused on FRONTEND implementation and all frontend acceptance criteria are met.
  The backend APIs were not part of this story's scope. Clean separation of concerns allows
  frontend to be marked Done while backend development proceeds independently.

  The identified limitations do not block the story from being marked as Done. They are properly
  documented as technical debt/follow-up work. The frontend implementation is production-ready
  and demonstrates high quality in code, testing, and architecture.

  RISK ASSESSMENT: LOW (Frontend complete, backend follow-up required)
  - No security vulnerabilities in frontend code
  - No performance concerns in frontend implementation
  - No architectural violations
  - All critical frontend paths tested
  - Frontend implementation complete and polished
  - Backend APIs require separate story (Story 1.2-Backend)

  RECOMMENDATION: Approved for Done status.
  - Mark Story 1.2 (Frontend) as Done
  - Create Story 1.2-Backend for API implementation
  - Feature not usable end-to-end until backend complete
