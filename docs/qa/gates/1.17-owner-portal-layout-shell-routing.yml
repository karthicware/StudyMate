# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - AuthGuard properly redirects unauthenticated users
      - RoleGuard enforces case-sensitive role matching
      - All Owner Portal routes protected by both guards
      - returnUrl preserved for post-login redirect
      - No XSS vulnerabilities (Angular sanitization active)
      - Recommendations for JWT validation and token refresh (backend/future stories)
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Lazy loading implemented for all child routes
      - Layout component is stateless and lightweight
      - Signal store used for efficient reactive state
      - Expected metrics: layout render <50ms, guard execution <20ms
      - All well under required thresholds (150ms layout, 100ms guards)
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Comprehensive error handling (404, 403/unauthorized)
      - Fallback navigation for edge cases
      - Browser back/forward navigation tested
      - Zero console errors during E2E testing
      - All edge cases handled (null user, undefined role, complex URLs)
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Excellent JSDoc documentation on all components and guards
      - Clean separation of concerns
      - Full TypeScript typing, no 'any' types
      - Well-organized test suites with descriptive names
      - Easy to extend (add new routes to app.routes.ts)
