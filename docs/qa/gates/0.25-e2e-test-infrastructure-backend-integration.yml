summary: |
  Story 0.25 represents EXCELLENT work on E2E test infrastructure. The implementation is:

  ✅ COMPREHENSIVE: All 6 acceptance criteria fully met
  ✅ PROVEN: 100% pass rate on 49 registration tests validates infrastructure works
  ✅ WELL-ARCHITECTED: Clean separation of concerns, reusable utilities, proper abstractions
  ✅ DOCUMENTED: Outstanding documentation with patterns, examples, and troubleshooting
  ✅ PRODUCTION-READY: CI/CD configuration, error handling, test isolation all in place
  ✅ IMPROVED DURING REVIEW: Schema drift prevention implemented and documented

  **QA Improvements Made:**
  During review, the schema drift risk was addressed by:
  - Enabling Flyway migrations in test mode (production-identical schema)
  - Configuring Hibernate to validate instead of auto-generate schema
  - Updating all scripts and documentation to reflect best practices
  - Creating comprehensive schema drift prevention guide

  The infrastructure now ensures E2E tests use the exact same database schema as production,
  preventing silent failures and catching schema mismatches immediately on server startup.

  This is infrastructure work done RIGHT, with proactive quality improvements. 🎯

gate_decision_rationale: |
  PASS gate decision based on:

  1. All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated
  2. 100% pass rate on registration test suite (49/49 tests) proves infrastructure works
  3. Comprehensive test utilities enabling all E2E testing patterns
  4. Excellent code quality with proper error handling and TypeScript typing
  5. Outstanding documentation (e2e-testing-guide.md is exemplary)
  6. Proper test isolation with database cleanup and seeding scripts
  7. CI/CD ready with headless mode, reports, and video capture
  8. No critical or high-severity issues identified
  9. NFR validation: All PASS (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
  10. Perfect compliance with coding standards and testing strategy

  Low-severity monitoring items are documented but don't warrant CONCERNS gate status.
  This is production-ready infrastructure that other stories can confidently build upon.
