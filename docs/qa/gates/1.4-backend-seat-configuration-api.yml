# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Multi-layered authorization (Spring Security + service-level ownership). Comprehensive validation prevents injection. No hardcoded credentials."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient batch operations with @Transactional. Appropriate use of flush(). No N+1 query problems."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling. Transaction rollback on failures. Database constraints as safety net."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns. Well-documented. Easy to extend."
