story: "1.3"
story_title: "Seat Map Visualization"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is solid with excellent test coverage, but has a minor method visibility issue and lacks production-grade error recovery. Recommended to address before production deployment."

    severity: medium
    finding: "Method visibility issue: loadSeatsWithPolling() is private but called from template retry button"
    suggested_action: "Change loadSeatsWithPolling() to public or create a separate public retry() method"

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix method visibility issue before production (CODE-001)"
    monitor:
      - "Consider implementing centralized logging service (CODE-002)"
      - "Consider adding exponential backoff for polling errors"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Polling endpoint requires authentication (owner role). No sensitive data exposure in client-side code."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SVG rendering is efficient. Polling interval (10s) is reasonable. Responsive design handles mobile viewports. Consider adding request debouncing if users report performance issues."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Error handling is present but could be enhanced with retry logic and exponential backoff for failed polling attempts. Current implementation just stops polling on error."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code is well-structured, typed, and follows Angular 20 best practices. Signals usage is exemplary. Component organization is clear and follows coding standards."
