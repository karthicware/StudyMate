    notes: "Excellent performance characteristics. SecretKey created once and reused. No unnecessary object creation. Efficient JJWT builder pattern usage."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive exception handling. Proper logging at appropriate levels. Defensive null/type checking in claims extraction. Fail-fast configuration validation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with clear separation of concerns. Excellent test coverage (17 unit tests). Good JavaDoc documentation. Follows Spring Boot and coding standards."
