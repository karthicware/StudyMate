review_notes: |
  This is an exemplary implementation of test infrastructure work. The developer systematically
  diagnosed and resolved three distinct root causes (API URL mismatch, empty test database,
  invalid BCrypt hashes) with excellent documentation throughout.

  The authentication infrastructure is now production-ready, with comprehensive helper utilities
  that demonstrate best practices in test architecture. The code quality is excellent and required
  no refactoring during QA review.

  The story correctly identifies that remaining E2E test failures are due to missing UI components
  (dashboard metrics, seat maps, footer/header components), not authentication issues. This is
  expected and properly documented. The auth infrastructure is complete and ready to support
  future UI implementation.

  Minor improvement opportunities identified are non-blocking and represent future enhancements
  rather than deficiencies.

  Quality score: 95/100 (EXCELLENT)
