# Additional notes
notes: |
  **Strengths:**
  - Excellent use of Angular 20 features (Signals, standalone components, inject())
  - Comprehensive unit tests with 90%+ coverage
  - Well-structured component with clear separation of concerns
  - Proper error handling and user feedback via toast notifications
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS utility classes
  - Good accessibility practices (ARIA attributes, semantic HTML)

  **Implementation Quality:**
  - Form validation is thorough with custom phone validator
  - Avatar upload includes proper client-side validation
  - Loading states managed consistently
  - Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments

  **Test Quality:**
  - Unit tests are comprehensive and well-organized
  - E2E tests cover all major user flows
  - Good use of mocking for isolated testing
  - Tests validate both happy path and error scenarios

  **Areas for Improvement:**
  - E2E tests need infrastructure setup (dev server)
  - Password change feature is incomplete
  - Consider enhancing upload UX with progress indicators

  **Dependencies:**
  - Story 1.19 (Profile API) must be completed and tested
  - Backend security measures should be validated
  - Integration testing with actual backend recommended
