nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'JWT authentication with @PreAuthorize, owner ID from JWT prevents impersonation, defensive null checks added, proper error handling. Recommendation: Add 401/403 test coverage.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Indexes on owner_id and status, @Transactional(readOnly=true) for queries, proper fetch strategy (LAZY), DB-level sorting. Minor concern: potential N+1 queries in list operations.'

    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive exception handling, database constraints as defense-in-depth, transaction management, proper logging. No retry mechanism for transient failures.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean architecture with layer separation, constructor DI, good JavaDoc, consistent naming, no duplication. Excellent testability through dependency injection.'

  overall_risk_score: 6  # Highest risk score triggers CONCERNS

gate_decision_rationale: |
  Gate decision is CONCERNS based on deterministic criteria:

  1. Risk Assessment: Overall risk score of 6 (test coverage debt) triggers CONCERNS (≥6 threshold)
  2. Issue Severity: 4 medium severity issues + 2 low severity issues
  3. NFR Status: All PASS (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
  4. Test Coverage: 60% actual (repository + service only) vs 90% target = GAP

  Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT
  - Clean architecture with proper layer separation
  - Follows all coding standards (constructor DI, validation, transactions, logging)
  - Strong test coverage at repository and service layers (19 tests, 100% passing)
  - Good security practices (JWT, role enforcement, defensive programming)
  - Well-documented code with JavaDoc
  - Proper error handling and database constraints

  Critical Gaps: TEST COVERAGE
  - Controller layer: 0 tests (should have 6+)
  - Integration layer: 0 tests (should have 3+)
  - Authorization scenarios: No test coverage
  - Validation scenarios: No test coverage
  - AC4 and AC5: Implemented but not tested
  - AC1, AC2, AC3: Tested at unit level but not end-to-end

  Quality Score: 80/100
  - Base: 100
  - Deduction: -10 × 4 medium issues = -40
  - Bonus: +20 for excellent code quality and strong unit test coverage

  Recommendation: CHANGES REQUIRED
  Add controller and integration tests to reach 90% coverage target, then mark Done.

  Team decision: Can accept technical debt and proceed, or complete tests first.

refactoring_log:
  - file: 'studymate-backend/src/main/java/com/studymate/backend/model/StudyHall.java'
    change: 'Added @NotBlank and @Size validation annotations to address, city, state, country fields'
    reason: 'AC5 specifies required fields but entity validation was incomplete. DTO had validation but entity did not.'
    impact: 'Defense-in-depth validation at both DTO and entity levels'
    lines: '47-69'
  - file: 'studymate-backend/src/main/java/com/studymate/backend/service/HallService.java'
    change: 'Clarified comment for seatCount initialization'
    reason: 'Original comment was ambiguous about redundancy'
    impact: 'Better code clarity and maintainability'
    lines: '66-67'
  - file: 'studymate-backend/src/main/java/com/studymate/backend/controller/HallController.java'
    change: 'Added defensive null checks for @AuthenticationPrincipal User in both endpoints'
    reason: 'Defensive programming - while Spring Security should prevent null, explicit validation is safer'
    impact: 'Better error handling and fail-fast behavior'
    lines: '55-57, 86-88'

dev_notes:
  - 'Architecture Decision: Used Long IDs instead of UUID to maintain consistency with existing codebase. All functional requirements met without breaking changes.'
  - 'Backward Compatibility: Maintained deprecated findByOwnerId() method for existing code.'
  - 'Test Execution: All 19 tests passing after QA refactoring (11 repository + 8 service).'
  - 'File List: Dev should update story File List to reflect QA modifications to StudyHall.java, HallService.java, HallController.java.'
