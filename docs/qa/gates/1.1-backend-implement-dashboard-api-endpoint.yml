# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "1.1"
story_title: "Implement Dashboard API Endpoint"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met. Critical security vulnerability (SEC-002) discovered and fixed during review. Previous QA concerns fully resolved. Performance test has minor data setup issue that doesn't affect production code."

# Waiver (not active)
waiver: { active: false }

# Issues found and fixed during this review
top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-002"
    severity: high  # CRITICAL mapped to high
    finding: "Missing @EnableMethodSecurity - ALL @PreAuthorize annotations were being ignored, allowing any authenticated user to access owner-only endpoints"
    suggested_action: "FIXED - Added @EnableMethodSecurity to SecurityConfig.java"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    resolution: "Added @EnableMethodSecurity annotation and import to SecurityConfig"

  - id: "DB-002"
    severity: high
    finding: "V4 migration script not idempotent - uses CREATE INDEX without IF NOT EXISTS, causing deployment failures"
    suggested_action: "FIXED - Made migration idempotent with IF NOT EXISTS clauses"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    resolution: "Changed CREATE INDEX to CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS in V4 migration"

  - id: "SEC-003"
    severity: medium
    finding: "AuthorizationDeniedException caught by generic exception handler, returning 500 instead of 403 Forbidden"
    suggested_action: "FIXED - Added dedicated handler for AuthorizationDeniedException"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    resolution: "Added @ExceptionHandler for AuthorizationDeniedException returning 403"

  - id: "PERF-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Performance test data setup issue - shows 0% occupancy instead of expected 70%"
    suggested_action: "FIXED - Changed endTime from now.plusHours(2) to now.plusDays(1)"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    resolution: "Root cause was timing issue with endTime vs CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. Fixed by using plusDays(1) instead of plusHours(2) to ensure bookings are definitely considered active. Both performance tests now passing (13ms execution, avg 11.60ms over 5 queries)."
