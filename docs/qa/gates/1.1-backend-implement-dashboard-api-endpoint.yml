  Review Summary:

  This implementation demonstrates solid software engineering with clean architecture,
  proper authorization checks, and comprehensive unit testing. The core business logic
  works correctly as validated by 7 passing unit tests and PostgreSQL MCP verification.

  However, critical quality assurance gaps prevent a PASS gate:

  1. Integration tests (3/3) fail due to Spring Security context configuration issues
  2. Performance requirement (< 500ms) not validated with automated tests
  3. Missing database indexes on foreign keys (seats.hall_id, bookings.seat_id)

  The code is production-ready from a functionality perspective, but the quality
  validation infrastructure is incomplete. The "must fix" items should be addressed
  before production deployment to ensure system reliability and performance.

  Positive highlights:
  - Excellent service layer design with multi-layer authorization
  - Well-optimized queries using LEFT JOIN to avoid N+1 problems
  - Proper error handling and security event logging
  - Good separation of concerns and code organization
