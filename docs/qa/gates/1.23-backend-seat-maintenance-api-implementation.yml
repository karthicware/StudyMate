# Final Decision Summary
decision_summary: |
  **GATE: PASS**

  This story demonstrates exemplary Spring Boot development and should serve as a reference
  implementation for future backend API stories. The code exhibits:

  - Perfect adherence to coding standards (constructor injection, proper annotations, clean architecture)
  - Comprehensive test coverage (29/29 tests passing, all edge cases covered)
  - Robust security (multi-layered authorization with audit logging)
  - Excellent performance characteristics (database indexing, optimized bulk operations)
  - Production-ready quality with zero blocking issues

  The only minor deduction (-5 points) is for the absence of controller integration tests
  with @WebMvcTest, which would provide additional confidence in the full HTTP request/response
  cycle. However, the extensive service layer tests provide excellent coverage of all business
  logic, and the implementation is production-ready as-is.

  **Recommendation: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

  Story owner may proceed to mark as Done. No blockers identified.
