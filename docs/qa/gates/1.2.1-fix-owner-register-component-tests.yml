  3. â CODE QUALITY: Exemplary Angular 20 best practices, defensive programming, type safety
  4. â ARCHITECTURE: Proper test isolation, balanced mocking strategy, comprehensive edge cases
  5. â NFRs: All non-functional requirements pass (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
  6. â TECHNICAL DEBT: Zero new debt introduced, 26 test failures eliminated (previous debt addressed)
  7. â DOCUMENTATION: Comprehensive completion notes serve as reference for future Router testing
  8. â REFACTORING: No refactoring needed - implementation is production-ready as-is
  9. â COMPLIANCE: All coding standards, project structure, and testing strategy requirements met
  10. â SECURITY: Zero vulnerabilities, proper RBAC enforcement, strong password validation

  The implementation demonstrates best-in-class test architecture and should serve as a
  reference example for the team. No improvements required - ready for production deployment.

  Key implementation highlights:
  - Used provideRouter([]) (Angular 20 best practice) instead of deprecated RouterTestingModule
  - Applied optional chaining (route.data?.['role']) for defensive programming
  - Improved test reliability using DOM assertions instead of internal metadata
  - Achieved 100% pass rate up from 90.7% (eliminated 26 test failures)
  - Maintained excellent performance (0.761s for 248 tests at ~3ms per test)
