test_failure_breakdown:

gate_decision_rationale: |
  PASS gate issued for pre-implementation review because:

  1. EXCELLENT DOCUMENTATION: Story is comprehensive with clear ACs, task breakdown, and context
  2. PROPER SCOPE: Expanded from 23 to 26 failures to address all Router-related issues
  3. ACCURATE STATE: Test counts updated (248 total, 26 failures)
  4. CLEAR SOLUTION: Recommends provideRouter([]) - correct Angular 20 pattern
  5. GOOD CONTEXT: Links to Story 1.14a and explains test suite growth

  Story is READY FOR DEVELOPMENT.

  Minor Improvements Made by QA:
  - Expanded scope to include 2 OwnerLayoutComponent failures
  - Added 1 roleGuard regression fix
  - Updated test counts from 232 to 248
  - Created expanded task breakdown (6 tasks)
  - Updated Change Log with version 1.1

path_to_implementation:
  steps:
    - "Dev starts with Task 1: Root cause analysis (verify all 26 failures)"
    - "Task 2: Fix OwnerRegisterComponent (23 tests) with provideRouter([])"
    - "Task 3: Fix OwnerLayoutComponent (2 tests) with same pattern"
    - "Task 4: Fix roleGuard regression (1 test) with proper route.data mocking"
    - "Task 5: Run full test suite and verify 248/248 passing"
    - "Task 6: Document solutions and update test patterns documentation"
    - "QA reviews implementation and creates post-implementation gate"

success_metrics:
  - "248/248 tests passing (100% pass rate)"
  - "Zero console errors/warnings"
  - "Coverage maintained or improved (currently 75.5%)"
  - "All 3 test file categories fixed"
  - "Solution documented for future reference"
