# Gate decision audit trail
history:
  - at: "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    gate: CONCERNS
    note: "Initial comprehensive QA review. Excellent implementation with minor security concerns acceptable for MVP. All 9 ACs met. 85%+ test coverage. Production-ready."

# Additional context
notes: |
  This story represents the first frontend authentication feature in Epic 0.1. The implementation demonstrates
  exceptional quality with:

  - 100% acceptance criteria coverage (9/9)
  - 85%+ test coverage with 20+ unit tests and 15 E2E tests
  - Full compliance with Angular 20 best practices
  - Comprehensive accessibility (ARIA attributes, WCAG AA)
  - Strong password validation with real-time feedback
  - Proper error handling for all scenarios

  The CONCERNS gate is solely due to documented security considerations that are either:
  1. Acceptable for MVP (localStorage for JWT as documented in Dev Notes)
  2. Backend responsibilities (rate limiting in Story 0.1.3)
  3. Future story dependencies (email verification page in Story 0.1.2)

  No blocking issues identified. Story is production-ready and recommended for Done status.

  Dependencies:
  - Story 0.1.2: Email Verification Page (frontend)
  - Story 0.1.3: Backend Owner Registration Endpoint
