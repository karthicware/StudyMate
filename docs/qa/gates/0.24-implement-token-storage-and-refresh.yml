# Quality score calculation
# Formula: 100 - (20 × high_severity_issues) - (10 × medium_severity_issues)
# = 100 - (20 × 1) - (10 × 2) = 100 - 20 - 20 = 60
# However, reliability failure brings this down to 30
quality_score: 30

# Evidence from review

# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      Implementation is functional but has security improvement opportunities:
      - No refresh token rotation (tokens can be refreshed indefinitely if compromised)
      - Tokens stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS attacks)
      - Consider httpOnly cookies for better protection
      - Backend properly validates account status before refresh
      - Interceptor prevents infinite loops

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Efficient implementation with good performance characteristics:
      - Timer-based refresh (no polling overhead)
      - Proper timer cleanup prevents memory leaks
      - Backend uses readOnly transactions for queries
      - JWT decoding only when needed

  reliability:
    status: FAIL
    notes: |
      Cannot confirm reliability with 79% test failure rate:
      - Backend: 100% tests passing (12/12) ✓
      - Frontend: 21% tests passing (10/47) ✗
      - Missing E2E validation of critical auth flow
      - Error handling may be too aggressive (logs out on any refresh failure)

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Code is clean, well-structured, and maintainable:
      - Clear separation of concerns
      - Good use of TypeScript types and Angular patterns
      - Comprehensive logging for debugging
      - Follows project coding standards
      - Well-commented complex logic

    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "Initial review - Backend excellent (12/12 tests), Frontend has critical test failures (37/47 failing). Implementation quality is good but test coverage blocks approval."

# Additional context
implementation_highlights:
  backend:
    - "Clean RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes"
    - "Validates user account status (enabled, not locked) before refresh"
    - "Comprehensive integration test coverage (12/12 passing)"
    - "Good error handling and logging"

  frontend:
    - "Well-architected automatic token refresh (5 min before expiry)"
    - "Proper timer management with cleanup on logout"
    - "HTTP interceptor correctly handles 401 with retry logic"
    - "Uses modern Angular patterns (inject(), Signals)"

test_summary:
  backend:
    total: 12
    passing: 12
    failing: 0
    coverage: "100%"

  frontend:
    total: 47
    passing: 10
    failing: 37
    coverage: "21%"
    failure_rate: "79%"

next_steps:
  for_developer:
    - "Fix component test router mocking (likely need provideRouter in TestBed)"
    - "Add E2E test using Playwright to validate full auth flow"
    - "Request QA re-review after fixes are complete"

  for_qa:
    - "Re-review after test fixes are implemented"
    - "Verify all 47 frontend tests pass"
    - "Validate E2E test coverage"
    - "If tests pass, gate should change to CONCERNS (due to security recommendations)"
