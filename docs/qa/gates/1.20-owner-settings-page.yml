## Final Verdict

**DECISION: PASS**

**Rationale:**
The implementation demonstrates exceptional quality across all dimensions:
- **100% requirements traceability** with all 9 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
- **Excellent code quality** following Angular 20 best practices with proper Signals, RxJS patterns, and memory management
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with 43 unit tests (79%+ coverage) and 20 E2E tests covering all user workflows
- **Strong NFR compliance** for security, performance, reliability, and maintainability
- **Zero critical or high-severity issues** identified

Minor accessibility concerns are documented for future improvement but do not block release.

**Recommendation:** **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**
