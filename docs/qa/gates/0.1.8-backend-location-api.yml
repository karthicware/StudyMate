    - action: "Add @Transactional annotation to HallService.updateLocation() method"
      refs: ["studymate-backend/src/main/java/com/studymate/backend/service/HallService.java:158"]
      rationale: "For consistency with other service methods and explicit transaction boundaries"
      implemented: "2025-10-23"
    - action: "Create HallStatus enum to replace string literals"
      refs: ["studymate-backend/src/main/java/com/studymate/backend/model/HallStatus.java"]
      rationale: "Improves type safety and prevents typos (e.g., 'DRAFT', 'ACTIVE')"
      implemented: "2025-10-23"
    - action: "Create Region enum to replace @Pattern validation"
      refs: ["studymate-backend/src/main/java/com/studymate/backend/model/Region.java"]
      rationale: "Better type safety and easier to extend region-specific logic"
      implemented: "2025-10-23"
