gate_decision_rationale: |
  Gate decision is PASS based on comprehensive assessment:

  1. Implementation Quality: EXCEPTIONAL
     - Clean architecture with proper layer separation
     - Follows all coding standards (constructor DI, validation, transactions, logging)
     - Strong defensive programming (null checks, error handling)
     - Excellent security practices (JWT, role enforcement)
     - Well-documented code with JavaDoc
     - Proper error handling and database constraints

  2. Test Coverage: EXCEPTIONAL (27/27 tests passing = 100%)
     - Repository layer: 11 comprehensive tests
