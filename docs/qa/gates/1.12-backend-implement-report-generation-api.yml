  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Authentication and authorization properly implemented, but missing rate limiting and input validation on date range length. Exception messages expose internal details."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Streaming response is good, but loading all bookings into memory is problematic for large datasets. No caching strategy implemented."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper exception handling, transaction management, and NULL-safe SQL queries. Validation of inputs present."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with excellent separation of concerns. Strategy pattern for generators is extensible. Comprehensive JavaDoc. Minor issue: hardcoded constants should be externalized."
