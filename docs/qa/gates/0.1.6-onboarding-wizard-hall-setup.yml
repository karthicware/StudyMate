# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JWT authentication required, owner authorization enforced, input validation (maxLength/pattern/required), no hardcoded credentials, SQL injection prevention via ORM, UNIQUE constraint on (owner_id, hall_name)"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Hall creation < 2s (requirement met), instant form validation, efficient HTTP calls (single POST/GET), loading states prevent double-submission, proper Angular signals usage"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "9 error scenarios handled with user-friendly messages, network error handling, all 73 tests passing with zero flakiness, zero console errors validated, proper async/await patterns"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JSDoc documentation on all service methods, type-safe TypeScript with proper interfaces, 91.17% test coverage enables confident refactoring, consistent naming conventions, clean separation of concerns"
