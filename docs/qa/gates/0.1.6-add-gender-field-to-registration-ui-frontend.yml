# Code Quality Assessment Detail
code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Follows Angular 20 best practices: standalone components, signals, inject() function"
    - "Strong TypeScript typing with Gender type and proper interfaces"
    - "Comprehensive unit test coverage (20+ tests for owner component)"
    - "Excellent password validation with strength indicator"
    - "Proper error handling with user-friendly messages"
    - "Good accessibility foundation with ARIA attributes"
    - "Tailwind CSS used consistently per design system"

    - "E2E test file specified in story but not created"
    - "Student registration template HTML not verified"
    - "No automated accessibility validation"
    - "Definition of Done incomplete (82% complete)"

  architecture:
    rating: "Excellent"

# Testing Architecture Assessment
test_architecture:
  unit_tests:
    coverage: "Excellent (90%+ estimated)"

    gaps: "Student registration component tests not reviewed"

  integration_tests:
    coverage: "None"
    quality: "N/A"
    gaps: "No integration tests with backend API"

  e2e_tests:
    coverage: "Missing"
    quality: "N/A"
    gaps: "E2E tests specified in story but not implemented (critical gap)"

  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 2
    low: 2
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "E2E tests must be implemented before production release (TEST-001)"
      - "Accessibility must be validated per AC5 requirements (TEST-002)"
    monitor:
      - "Student registration template should be verified (IMPL-001)"
      - "Definition of Done should be completed (DOC-001)"

# Technical Debt
technical_debt:
  identified:
    - item: "E2E test coverage gap"
      severity: medium
      effort: "2-3 hours"
    - item: "Accessibility validation gap"
      severity: medium
      effort: "1-2 hours"

  recommendations:
    - "Address E2E and accessibility gaps before marking story Done"
    - "Consider establishing automated accessibility testing pipeline"
