final_recommendation: |
  Story 1.21 - Owner Settings API Implementation has successfully passed all quality gates.

  The implementation demonstrates excellent software engineering practices:
  - Clean architecture with proper layer separation
  - Comprehensive test coverage (100% of requirements)
  - Proper transaction and validation handling
  - Well-documented code with clear intent
  - Database design follows normalization principles

  All acceptance criteria have been met and verified through automated tests.
  Non-blocking recommendations have been documented for future enhancement but do not
  prevent production deployment.
