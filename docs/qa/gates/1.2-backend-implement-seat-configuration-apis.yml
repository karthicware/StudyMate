strengths:
  - "Excellent test coverage with 19 comprehensive unit tests covering all edge cases"
  - "Proper validation at both DTO level (@Valid annotations) and service level (business logic)"
  - "Security best practices: multi-layer authorization, security event logging"
  - "Performance optimizations: @Transactional, batch operations (saveAll), database indexes"
  - "Clean separation of concerns: Controllers -> Services -> Repositories"
  - "Proper error handling with appropriate exception types"
  - "Database migration properly created for schema changes"
  - "JSONB handling correctly implemented for complex shift configuration"
  - "Comprehensive overlap validation for shift times with detailed error messages"
  - "Code follows established patterns from previous stories"

requirements_traceability:
  AC1_seat_endpoints:
    - Given: User is authenticated as OWNER and owns the hall
      When: POST /api/v1/owner/seats/config/{hallId} with valid seat data
      Then: Seats are saved, seat_count updated, 200 OK returned
      Tests: "SeatConfigurationServiceTest.saveSeatConfiguration_Success"
    - Given: Seat numbers are not unique within request
      When: POST seat configuration
      Then: 400 Bad Request with validation error
      Tests: "SeatConfigurationServiceTest.saveSeatConfiguration_DuplicateSeatNumber"
    - Given: User is not the hall owner
      When: Any seat configuration operation
      Then: 403 Forbidden with security logging
      Tests: "SeatConfigurationServiceTest.saveSeatConfiguration_UserNotOwner"
    - Given: Hall does not exist
      When: Any seat configuration operation
      Then: 404 Not Found
      Tests: "SeatConfigurationServiceTest.saveSeatConfiguration_HallNotFound"

  AC2_shift_endpoints:
    - Given: Valid shift configuration with no overlaps
      When: POST /api/v1/owner/shifts/config/{hallId}
      Then: Configuration saved to JSONB column, 200 OK returned
      Tests: "ShiftConfigurationServiceTest.saveShiftConfiguration_Success"
    - Given: Shifts have overlapping times
      When: POST shift configuration
      Then: 400 Bad Request with overlap details
      Tests: "ShiftConfigurationServiceTest.saveShiftConfiguration_OverlappingShifts"
    - Given: No shift configuration exists
      When: GET shift configuration
      Then: Default shifts returned (06:00-22:00 with 3 shifts)
      Tests: "ShiftConfigurationServiceTest.getShiftConfiguration_ReturnsDefaultsWhenEmpty"

  AC3_testing:
    - All 19 unit tests passing
    - Test coverage exceeds 90% requirement
    - Database migration validated
    - Performance optimizations verified (batch operations, transactions)
