gate_decision_rationale: |
  CONCERNS gate issued due to:

  1. INACCURATE REPORTING: Story claims "100% pass rate (87/87)" but actual is "90.1% (209/232)"
     - Impact: Misleading stakeholders about test health
     - Severity: HIGH

  2. TYPESCRIPT ERRORS: Tests had compilation errors preventing execution
     - Impact: Tests couldn't run until QA fixed them
     - Severity: HIGH
     - Resolution: Fixed by QA during review

  3. INCOMPLETE ACs: AC4, AC5, AC6 not met
     - Impact: Technical debt for future stories
     - Severity: MEDIUM

  4. SCOPE DRIFT: Story pivoted from Router to styling fixes without documentation
     - Impact: Confusion about actual work completed
     - Severity: MEDIUM

  POSITIVE ASPECTS:
  - Core work (MetricCard, App tests) completed correctly
  - Router configuration was already proper (good discovery)
  - QA able to fix TypeScript errors
  - Test architecture follows best practices

  RECOMMENDATION: Changes Required
  - Update story with accurate information
  - Acknowledge scope change
  - Create follow-up tasks for incomplete ACs
  - Update File List with QA modifications

path_to_pass:
  steps:
    - "Dev updates story completion notes with accurate test counts (209/232)"
    - "Dev adds QA-modified files to File List"
    - "Dev updates Change Log acknowledging scope change"
    - "Scrum Master creates Story 1.2.1 for OwnerRegisterComponent test fixes"
    - "Team decides: Create Story 1.14b for utilities/docs OR waive AC5/AC6"
    - "Once above complete, gate can be upgraded to PASS"

  alternative_waiver:
    condition: "If utilities truly not needed for Stories 1.15-1.21"
    process: "Scrum Master formally waives AC5/AC6 with justification in story"
    impact: "Gate could move to PASS with waiver active"

    note: "Initial review - TypeScript errors fixed by QA, completion claims inaccurate, ACs incomplete"
