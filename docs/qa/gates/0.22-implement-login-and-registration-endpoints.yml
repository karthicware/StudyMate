# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Critical passwordHash exposure vulnerability was identified and fixed during review. BCrypt hashing, JWT implementation, and Spring Security configuration are excellent. Rate limiting recommended for future implementation but not blocking."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient database queries, proper transactional boundaries, stateless JWT authentication. No bottlenecks identified."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, proper transaction management, account status validation (enabled/locked). All edge cases covered."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture with SOLID principles, constructor injection, good documentation, comprehensive tests. Refactored duplicate code during review."
