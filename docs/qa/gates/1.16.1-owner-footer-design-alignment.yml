final_assessment: |
  **GATE STATUS: PASS** ✅

  This is an exemplary implementation that exceeds quality expectations. The footer component
  demonstrates best-in-class practices across all dimensions:

  **Strengths:**
  - 100% acceptance criteria coverage with comprehensive traceability
  - 126 total tests (33 unit + 93 E2E) providing exhaustive validation
  - Perfect design system alignment with Section 9 specifications
  - Outstanding code quality with excellent documentation
  - Full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
  - Zero security, performance, or reliability concerns
  - Exemplary adherence to Angular 20 and TypeScript best practices

  **Test Architecture:**
  The test suite is particularly noteworthy, featuring:
  - Computed style validation (RGB values, pixel measurements)
  - Visual regression testing across 3 viewport sizes
  - Comprehensive responsive behavior validation
  - Console error/warning monitoring
  - Interactive state testing (hover, cursor, transitions)

  **Recommendations:**
  Two low-priority future enhancements suggested, but neither blocks production readiness.

  **Verdict:** Ready for immediate production deployment. This implementation serves as a
  model for future design system alignment stories.
