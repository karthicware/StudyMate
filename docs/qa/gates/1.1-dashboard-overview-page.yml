# Architecture & design patterns observed
patterns:
  strengths:
    - "Signal-based reactive state management (Angular 20 modern pattern)"
    - "Reusable component design (MetricCard, SeatMap)"
    - "Computed values for derived state"
    - "Proper error boundary with loading/error/success states"
    - "SVG for scalable graphics"
    - "Lazy loading for performance"

  exemplary_practices:
    - "Comprehensive test coverage as documentation"
    - "Console error detection in E2E tests"
    - "Responsive design testing"
    - "User-friendly error messages"
    - "TypeScript strict mode adherence"

# Review notes
notes: |
  This story sets an excellent standard for the Owner Portal implementation. The code demonstrates:

  1. **Modern Angular Mastery**: Proper use of Angular 20 features including standalone components,
     signals, computed values, and the inject() function.

  2. **Component Architecture**: The MetricCard and SeatMap components are well-designed, reusable,
     and follow single responsibility principle.

  3. **Test Excellence**: 43 total tests (34 unit + 9 E2E) provide comprehensive coverage and serve
     as living documentation. The inclusion of console error detection and responsive testing shows
     attention to production quality.

  4. **Production-Ready Code**: Error handling, loading states, empty states, and graceful degradation
     are all properly implemented.

  5. **Zero Technical Debt**: No shortcuts were taken. No "TODO" comments or incomplete implementations.

  This implementation should be used as a reference for future Owner Portal features.
