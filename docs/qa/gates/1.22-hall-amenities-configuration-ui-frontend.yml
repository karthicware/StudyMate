# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. API authentication inherited from existing infrastructure. No sensitive data exposure. Backend validates all amenity codes."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Auto-save debounce (500ms) prevents excessive API calls. distinctUntilChanged prevents duplicates. Proper subscription cleanup prevents memory leaks."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with loading states and user feedback. All edge cases tested (empty amenities, single amenity, both amenities, API errors)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation of concerns (service/model/component). Proper TypeScript types. JSDoc comments. Follows Angular 20 patterns. All UI elements have data-testid for testing."

# Detailed Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No immediate actions required - ready for production

  future:  # Optional enhancements for future consideration
    - action: "Consider adding toast notifications for amenity save errors"
      refs: ["studymate-frontend/src/app/features/owner/seat-map-config/seat-map-config.component.ts:512-515"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Currently shows error in errorMessage signal. Toast would be more visible to users."

    - action: "Add animation transition for success indicator"
      refs: ["studymate-frontend/src/app/features/owner/seat-map-config/seat-map-config.component.html:40-42"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Success indicator appears/disappears instantly. Smooth fade transition would improve UX."

# Architecture & Design Review
architecture:
  patterns_used:
    - "Reactive Forms with Signals (Angular 20)"
    - "Service Layer Pattern (separation of concerns)"
    - "Observable streams with RxJS operators (debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged)"
    - "Auto-save with debounce (borrowed from Story 1.20)"
    - "Component reuse (extended existing seat-map-config vs new component)"

  strengths:
    - "Clean separation: HallAmenitiesService handles all API calls"
    - "Proper TypeScript interfaces (HallAmenities, UpdateHallAmenitiesRequest)"
    - "Reactive state management with signals (loading, saving, success)"
    - "Prevents race conditions with emitEvent: false on load"
    - "Proper cleanup with takeUntil(destroy$) to prevent memory leaks"

  design_decisions:
    - decision: "Extended existing seat-map-config component instead of creating new component"
      rationale: "Amenities are hall-specific settings, logically grouped with seat configuration"
      assessment: CORRECT

    - decision: "Used auto-save pattern instead of explicit Save button"
      rationale: "Consistency with Story 1.20 Owner Settings pattern"
      assessment: CORRECT

    - decision: "500ms debounce for auto-save"
      rationale: "Prevents excessive API calls during rapid checkbox toggles"
      assessment: OPTIMAL

# Security Analysis
security:
  authentication:
    mechanism: "Inherited from existing Owner authentication flow"
    assessment: PASS

  authorization:
    mechanism: "Backend validates owner owns the hall (Story 1.22-backend)"
    assessment: PASS

  input_validation:
    client_side: "Not applicable (checkboxes only accept boolean)"
    server_side: "Backend validates amenity codes (only AC and WiFi allowed)"
    assessment: PASS

  data_exposure:
    sensitive_data: "None - only amenity flags (AC, WiFi)"
    assessment: PASS

  vulnerabilities_found: []

# Performance Analysis
performance:
  api_calls:
    - endpoint: "GET /owner/halls/{hallId}/amenities"
      frequency: "Once per hall selection"
      optimization: "Optimal - no unnecessary calls"

    - endpoint: "PUT /owner/halls/{hallId}/amenities"
      frequency: "After 500ms debounce + distinct change"
      optimization: "Optimal - debounce prevents rapid-fire calls"

  memory_management:
    - aspect: "RxJS subscription cleanup"
      implementation: "takeUntil(destroy$) on all subscriptions"
      assessment: CORRECT

    - aspect: "Signal updates"
      implementation: "Signals used for reactive state (no unnecessary re-renders)"
      assessment: OPTIMAL
