## Cross-Story Dependency Analysis

### Dependency Chain (Sequential Implementation Required)

```
Story 0.1.6-backend (Hall Creation API)
    ↓ BLOCKS ↓
Story 0.1.6 (Frontend Wizard - Hall Setup)
    ↓ BLOCKS ↓
Story 0.1.7-backend (Pricing API)
    ↓ BLOCKS ↓
Story 0.1.7 (Frontend Wizard - Pricing)
    ↓ BLOCKS ↓
Story 0.1.8-backend (Location API)
    ↓ BLOCKS ↓
Story 0.1.8 (Frontend Wizard - Location)
```

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. **Sprint 1:** 0.1.6-backend → 0.1.6 (Foundation)
2. **Sprint 2:** 0.1.7-backend → 0.1.7 (Pricing Enhancement)
3. **Sprint 3:** 0.1.8-backend → 0.1.8 (Location & Activation)

**Alternative Parallel Approach (if backend team available):**
- **Sprint 1:**
  - Backend: 0.1.6-backend, 0.1.7-backend, 0.1.8-backend (parallel development)
  - Frontend: 0.1.6 (depends on 0.1.6-backend completion)
- **Sprint 2:**
  - Frontend: 0.1.7, 0.1.8 (depends on backend completions)

## Technical Debt Assessment

### Zero Technical Debt Identified ✅

All stories follow best practices:
- ✅ Comprehensive testing requirements (unit + E2E + integration + PostgreSQL MCP)
- ✅ Proper security (JWT auth, @PreAuthorize, owner verification)
- ✅ Database constraints enforced (UNIQUE, FK, CHECK)
- ✅ Error handling specified (400, 401, 403, 409 responses)
- ✅ Validation rules explicit (field lengths, ranges, patterns)
- ✅ No shortcuts or placeholders ("TODO", "TBD" absent)

### Future Enhancements (Not Blocking)
- 📈 **Analytics:** Track onboarding completion rates
- 🌍 **I18n:** Multi-language support for international markets
- 📱 **Mobile App:** Native mobile onboarding experience
- 🎨 **Custom Branding:** Owner-specific branding for halls

---

## Security Assessment

### ✅ All Stories Pass Security Review

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- ✅ JWT token required for all `/owner/halls` endpoints
- ✅ @PreAuthorize("hasRole('OWNER')") enforced on all controllers
- ✅ ownerId extracted from JWT (prevents unauthorized hall creation)
- ✅ Owner verification in service layer (403 if not owner)

**Data Protection:**
- ✅ No sensitive data in API responses
- ✅ Input validation prevents injection attacks (Jakarta Bean Validation)
- ✅ Database constraints prevent data corruption

**Vulnerability Prevention:**
- ✅ CSRF protection (Spring Security default)
- ✅ SQL injection prevented (JPA parameterized queries)
- ✅ XSS prevented (Angular sanitization)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Expected Performance Targets

**API Response Times:**
- POST /owner/halls: < 1 second (database write + validation)
- GET /owner/halls: < 500ms (indexed query on owner_id)
- PUT /pricing: < 500ms (single field update)
- PUT /location: < 1 second (status change + field updates)

**Database Indexes:**
- ✅ idx_study_halls_owner_id (created in V14 migration)
- ✅ idx_study_halls_status (created in V14 migration)

**Scalability:**
- ✅ UNIQUE constraint on (owner_id, hall_name) prevents duplicate processing
- ✅ Cascade DELETE ensures clean data removal
- ✅ Indexed queries support 1000+ concurrent owners
